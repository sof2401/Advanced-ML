spending the morning shopping in Santa Barbara and we were completely blown away!  Let's start with the staff - each person with whom we had contact was happy to be there, engaging, and friendly.  What a great start to the experience.  We both ordered tacos and couldn't have been happier.  I ordered the grilled veggie tacos - they had some spice but were cooled by the queso fresco.  Hubby ordered the chicken tacos and though more spicy than the veggie ones, weren't so spicy that they couldn't be inhaled!  Both sets of tacos were elevated to the next level by the homemade tortillas.  Simply delicious and authentic.", "This place has really turned itself around over the years. I just noticed my bad review from 2009 and felt I should update now that the place is run completely differently. The food is now excellent and the staff courteous.", "Was pretty disappointed. Went on the opening night of there remodel, had a good time. Then went back the next night with a group of friends. They would not except my out of state ID can you believe that!! In Santa Barbara a \"tourist town\". I Had been going there for years and never had an issue with my AZ ID. I gave them my credit card, my California sales license and a work license and still was not good enough. I am 25yrs old.. They rejected my ID the lady asked me for a passport. Now What would I, an American in America be caring around my passport for??  will not be bringing my business there. See Ya sandbar.", "Best Mexican grill and bar in Santa Barbara. Our server Lillian was the very best, Will definitely come again. Already planning breakfast tomorrow morning!", "This has to be the worse service. Got seated right away and then sat and waited. No one even acknowledged we were here for a good 15 min. Then another couple was seated near us. They got asked for drinks and food order before we were even acknowledged. Finally our waiter came, took our order and left. We got chips and finished them. Waiter asked if we wanted more, we said yes. Everyone around us got more chips, and we still wait for our food. The couple seated after us got their food and we finally get more chips, but no food. \n\nWorse service, will not eat here again.", "Margaritas! Margaritas! Margaritas!\n\nGreat Bar! Great service! Good vibes!\n\nCame to this bar twice over the weekend, our drinks Margarita and Mojito were made just right! ( If not mistaken, Scott (?) bartender was very friendly, helpful and skilled  young guy).\nVery nice touch from Sandbar - free freshly baked chips and salsa offered for the table as soon as you seated.\n\nThey play variable music and you can definitely catch up on some sport games on big screens all around you.\n\nWill be back!", "A group of 9 of us went to Sandbar on a Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday. The person taking the reservation was friendly and helpful. We couldn't get a table on the patio, but the table we were seated was open to the outside so we did not feel closed in. Our server was outstanding. He was very attentive and interacted well with everyone in the group. I had the La Asada con Salsa and it was outstanding. The meat was tender and the marinade was very flavorful. My wife said her tacos were the best she had in a long time as the ground meat tasted like good steak. Everyone had something different and said their food was excellent. All our food was served at the same time (not easy with a large group) and at a proper temperature. They brought up some flan to celebrate the birthday and it was the best flan I have eaten. Sandbar is a busy place (especially on a weekend evening) but they have a large staff that really hustle and appear to work well as a team. We will be back when we come back to Santa Barbara.", "Food was amazing. I really don't see to much of a difference in the new renovations but it does look cleaner. I'd  recommend this place to anyone.especialy on happy hour.", "We just went to get a table outside with our pup and the hostess told us we could tie our dog up to the fence on the outside. Governor Jerry Brown passed a law in CA allowing well behaved dogs to be in outdoor restaurant areas on a leash. Hm!?", "Nice place. Great service. Awesome margarita!!!! It is my second time at this restaurant. I will definitely come back ))))", "I have returned to Sandbar several more times for both dinner and breakfast since my last brief review and I have to say, this place now pops up at the top of my list when I'm craving Mexican food downtown and a bustling atmosphere. I've had their chicken soft taco plate, the three mini taco plate, one of their burritos, their chicken fajitas, and one of their breakfast hash dishes. All were excellent and get extra points for visually pleasing classy presentation. Top quality breast chicken or gristle free steak is huge for me and they prepare it wonderfully. This isn't bar food, this is a nice Mexican restaurant with a bar.", "Wow. Love the new look. Always seated fast and by far the best chips and salsa in town. Today was so busy being it Saturday afternoon the resturant was packed but we felt totaly taken care of by our waitress Shannon. GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!", "Great happy hour!! Margaritas are on point and the food is delicious and fresh. Check out the tostada salad.", "Had the boat in SB for several weeks so we had the opportunity to try Sandbar's new Breakfast/Brunch two weekends in a row.  First one, on 4/5 sold us on the new cool deal, $7.50 for a great breakfast, Kings Hawaiian bread french toast with eggs, bacon and potatoes, also included a Bloody Mary, Screwdriver or a Grayhound!  Awesome deal, and the food was awesome as well, Lillian was our server, she was great, very friendly and helpful.  We came back again next weekend on 4/11 and got the same great deal, food was fantastic once again, got the Grayhounds this time and our server was Jessilynn, she was really cool, efficient, friendly and very helpful.  This place rocks, it's beautiful, outdoor seating with really nice tables and booths with firepits.  Go and enjoy great drinks, excellent food and service.", "Went to this restaurant on a whim, and it was the best stop! The guy at the front was very friendly and cute. The food was very good! Their portions are huge and the prices are super reasonable for being on state street.", "this place was packed with a great ambience. my bartender austin was amazing very friendly and upbeat. we happen to talk to a girl that was very smiley and friendly.  she was very interactive with all the guests and her staff oh snap she happens to be one of the managers on duty. she asked us where we from and asked me what i did for work. she actually cared about what i was saying. lol so long story short. i definitely will be back even if i have to drive an hour to get there. well  worth it thank you lillian and austin for making my sunday funday sooooo much better . xoxo", "Red is awesome!  This girl rocks. I wish every bar had a red. Her drinks are the best. Dirty martinis are not my \"jam\" but reds dirty martinis are bomb! She is a Rockstar", "Always come here for Mexican food when I come to town and I'm always impressed by food, staff and the atmosphere. Food is delicious and always on point. Happy hour always a deal buy a beer and get one for quarter:) Great location and facilities. Staff is always helpful, nice and respectful. It's a great bar/restaurant in SB.", "After many visits to the Sandbar the last visit might be the last. Last week my husband and I went with our two friends. They have a two year old and so do we. Has we drove by the restaurant we noticed there was a couple with a stroller eating at the restaurant. One of our kids was asleep so we decided to take the stroller with the sleeping child in it. \n\n     Once we got to the front the hostess informed us that we would have to fold the stroller and put it in a designated stroller area because we couldn't take it in the restaurant (we agreed to it) we completely understand.  What we didn't understand is why there was somebody else already sitting there with a stroller open. We didn't question it. Clair (the hostess) asked how many people were in our party. It was a total of four adults and two children. Clair asked us if we wanted to sit in the high chairs or low ones. We requested the low ones. She gave us a look and asked someone else if that would be possible. What came out of her mouth next is ridiculous! Clair said \"But the kids have to sit on a chair they can't be held because it's a hazard\".  Clair you clearly have much to learn in the world of customer service  and better yet in life!\n\n     I contact the restaurant to file a formal complain. I spoke to one of the supervisors who apologized and said Clair was one of the newer employees. The supervisor took my name and number and assure me that the manager would contact me no later than the next day. Well it has now been three days later and I'm still waiting. \n\n     To an extent my party and I felt like Clair didn't want us to eat at the restaurant. I'm not sure what it is she was basing her hostility at? Was it the fact we had children with us (at 3 in the afternoon) or was it the way we looked? It's unfortunate that they have an employee of that sort has the first line of contact with the clients. With that said with so many options of restaurants on state street the Sandbar will definitely not be on our list.", "This place is the BOMB!!!! food is Mexican Cuisine at its finest! We went on 5/13/2015 with my wife. The service was great from start to finish! Our waitress Aby was the best waitress ever! she greeted us with a smile even though the Restaurant was very busy. Thank you Aby!", "We had dinner at Sandbar while we were in town for my sister's bachelorette party. We loved it! Cool atmosphere and delicious margaritas. I wish we had stayed there all night, because we left and went to EOS (we had a package there) and sandbar was clearly the better choice! Very fun!", "My friend and I went to Sandbar yesterday to grab drinks and check out the new remodel. The pictures looked awesome, so we wanted to see it for ourselves. We were happy to see it wasn't very busy and were seated at a table outside but near the bar. We were promptly delivered chips and salsa and ate that while waiting for our server to come take our drink order. 10 minutes after being seated, I heard a gentleman say into his ear piece/communication thing that \"table 12 has been sitting there for awhile with only chips and salsa, no drinks.\" We thought we would be helped after that but no such luck. We sat there for another 30 minutes waiting to put in our order. No one ever came to our table or even looked our direction and we watched while tables who were seated after us received their drinks and food before us. Finally after waiting close to 40 minutes we finally gave up and left. As we were leaving, the host asked us if we enjoyed our drinks. We informed him that we never saw our server to order our drinks. There was no apology or anything, he simply said \"oh, I think the bar was in charge of that section, they should have helped you.\" Perhaps he was new, he was very nice, but he definitely did not appear to know how to handle the situation and did not attempt to remedy it in any way. Due to the negligent and inattentive service, I will most likely not be returning to Sandbar.", "Great outdoor dining with an interesting horchata/pi\u00f1a colada drink that must be tasted!\n\nThe food is home style Mexican and was truly amazing: seafood enchiladas, chicken burrito, and soft tacos all disappeared quickly.\n\nBest of all - truly excellent service!\n(I was 5 tables away, but the hostess noticed I needed a new knife and brought me one before I could ask!", "My co-worker and I were looking for something that caught our attention for dinner, Sandbar did just that, excellent drinks, authentic and delicious mexican food, and the outdoor environment made me feel comfortable and like I was in Mexico downtown cantina, Great place,  so good I went back the next day! Lillian was our server and was most helpful with suggestions, service and local things to see, this was my favorite dinner in Santa Barbara after spending 7 days here :) Shari from Seattle", "This place will receive no stars from me... We were walking up state street with our daughters on Saturday before Father's Day and stumbled across this place... They were able to seat is quickly so we decided to try it... The food was ok, but the manager is a JERK!!!! My 5yr old is autistic and has certain quirks, one being shredding paper to keep her calm and dinner peaceful... We had almost finished our dinner and everything was going great until the manager walked us to us and told us not to let her drop paper on the floor because he doesn't want his guys to have to keep cleaning it up.... It's a restaurant duche bag stuff is gonna fall on the floor!!!!  Our family goes out to restaurants on a very regular basis and have never had anyone say anything to us about her paper, we always clean up her mess on our own before we leave and usually they tell us not to worry about it... This A-hole basically ruined the experience and humiliated us in the process... The place is crowded and close quarters so others heard him and we pretty much packed up and left immediately... Is he going to tell a parent with a toddler to make sure they don't drop their food on the floor????? This was very upsetting!!! Not a good place to go if you or your family member have special needs and if you want to Support the cause don't go to this place - the manager discriminates!!!", "I came here during the afternoon and the environment is chill but fun. Got some really good carne asada tacos and a Moscow mule. My waitress lil h was the shit and very friendly.", "The food is great, but the service is phenomenal. Art made sure my family was taken care of, and even made recommendations and suggestions when were were stunned by the variety. He was personable, friendly, and very helpful.", "Good food. Nice patio. Abbey was a wonderful server. She made the experience fun.  \n\nWe were walking down State Street looking for a good place to eat and their outdoor seating and friendly hostess caught our attention.  Glad it did.\n\nThe food was more upscale mexican food, but not so fancy that it forgot what it was.  We had the tostadas and the burrito del playa.  Both were great!", "Oh my god!!! These are the best carne asada tacos we have ever had!  They are even better than the ones i make!  If your ever in Santa Barbara on State Street stop on and eat about 10 of them!!!! So totally incredible!", "This place touches every end of the spectrum. If you want to sit in doors, they have it, if you want to people watch on the best, and busiest patio in santa Barbara, they have it... wanna lounge by a fire pit, they have it. Want a old margarita? they have it... want good food, happy hour, brunch?? They have it... Wanna dance and have a good time at night? They have that too. Food is good, portions are generous, prices are great, and life is good by the fire pit.", "Been here a few times the last 7 or 8 years and it's a nice place. The food is fantastic and the staff and atmosphere is great. Came here on a date and just to hang out and it was cool either way. The guacamole is fantastic and the rest of the food is pretty good, too. Overall, I really enjoy coming here", "This is my first review on Yelp. I feel like I have a responsibility to warn people to stay away from this dump. \n\nWhere to begin? Let's start with the hair. That's right, my sister's margarita glass wasn't just rimmed with salt -- she also found a hair! The bright side: the hair in your margarita will give you something to talk about as you wait...and wait...and wait...for them to bring out your food. \n\nYou can also fill up on their flat Coke with no fizz. \n\nWhen they finally do bring out your food (after what feels like 6 hours) you'll have to eat with one hand. Because you'll need the other hand to swat the flies infesting the outdoor patio (it's an admittedly nice patio, and what tricked us into entering this hell hole). But the flies are a distraction from the bland food (we had tostadas, fish tacos and burgers) that will later send you racing to the bathroom in a diarrhetic attack. \n\nJust don't expect to use the bathroom at this restaurant. I was headed for the men's room but the stench right outside the door was so strong that I did an about-face, asked our snotty waitress for the check (her attitude was what you'd expect from a waitress at a three-star Michelin restaurant) and got the hell out of there. \n\nThe whole experience was comical. At least we got a laugh out of it. We laughed at the hair, at the flies, at the poor service, at the crappy food, at the smelly bathroom. But the next morning my upset stomach was churning and I wasn't laughing anymore. I was pissed off. And I came here to write this review. \n\nThe Sandbar: enter at your own risk! You've been warned.", "Looking for great food, awesome drinks, friendly staff, a nightclub that will have you on the dance floor all night long? Then SANDBAR is the spot to be at ! Always a great time !", "Delicious food, vibrant atmosphere and great service!  Sandbar is a must do!  Nachos with beef was amazing!  Guacamole was creamy and flavorful!  Visiting from Charlotte, NC and couldn't have stumbled upon a better place for lunch!  Thanks to Yelp!", "I always wondered why there was a line outside of Sandbar. \n\nToday I found out. When I went there there were about 20% of tables with no one at them.  But everyone that went to the hostess was told there was a 10 to 15 minute wait. I asked why. I was told the kitchen was recovering from a large group. So it was better for us to wait on State St. Instead of a table.\n\nWe waited anyway. Food average. Plenty of other places in town with a better system and better food. \n\nThey make people wait on State St so it looks popular.  Don't fall for there ploy. \nI'm never going back!", "Jason at Sandbar is amazing. He made me and my friend the most amazing drinks & was very fun! Thank you thank you so much for taking care of us and making us have a good time!", "My boyfriend and I were dining here a couple months back, and we saw 2 guys with their girlfriends trying to get a table. These guys were very obviously Mexican. The hostess didn't let them in because she said their shorts were \"too baggy,\" or something stupid like that. No kidding, about 10 minutes later, a white family walks in and the man in that group was wearing shorts that were just as \"baggy\" as the other guys we wearing. But they let him in, no problem. For a \"Mexican\" restaurant, they really aren't very Mexican friendly. And being Mexican myself, I can honestly say I will never dine there again.", "Last weekend I visited this restaurant several times and each time it was wonderful.  The food and service was great and I want to thank Arthur and Nicolette and the rest of the staff for a great time.  I will be back to revisit soon.", "The food was amazing and let's not talk about the margaritas! The service was good and a nice little spot to hang out near the beach....", "Sorry ass DJ , salty ass food , salty ass security guards... Don't waste time and money here", "Visited them during happy hour Friday. It was really happy hour. great service, great food and  great drink. Try their nacho with chicken!", "I've had absolutely terrible service on multiple visits. Clearly this isn't something they care to improve and I will not be back.\nDon't waste your time or money.", "I took my wife shopping in Santa Barbara and stopped by during happy hour for a beer. I'm not a cheap person but $6.75 for a 8 ounce glass of 805 beer is not considered happy hour.. The facilities are nothing to write home about so the place should be added to the list of current tourist  traps. I'm a good tipper  but I  hate getting ripped off. Fortunately there are many other great places nearby. \nNEVER AGAIN !!!!", "Ate here yesterday and loved it! Our server was awesome, very knowledgable and on top of it. Skinny strawberry margarita is delicious and refreshing. Best food item we had: the steak fajitas! Would definitely recommend and will be back. Enjoyed the indoor/outdoor seating. Thanks!", "Great service, great food, great drinks. My margarita was pretty strong, which I can appreciate at a restaurant (normally they aren't worth the money). I got a taco and enchilada combo plate which was plenty of food and quite tasty. I think this restaurants strong point is the atmosphere - open, outdoor seating with beautiful lighting and nice music. Not so dark that you can't see, but creates a cool vibe. The staff was very capable and friendly, from start to finish. Definitely where I take all my out of town guests!", "I'd like to repost this review because I find it to still be relevant... Aron the manager is still giving the same b.s. Responses to people who are continuing to be discriminated against... I'm sorry, isn't there something I the Constitution about this sort of blatant discrimination??? \n\nIs it possible to give a ZERO STARS rating? \n\nMy husband and I have visited the Sandbar every time we have come to Santa Barbara for the last few years. The food is mediocre at best, the service was always less than amazing but we always enjoyed the atmosphere and so, always returned - it was always our first stop for a drink when we would come into town. This past trip, when my husband approached the hostess stand, the hostess informed him she could not seat the party (of 10 people no less) because of HIS visible neck tattoo - a tattoo that is a picture of me, his wife, and my name, Candace... This is bizarre for a number of reasons - 1. We have been to the Sandbar A MINIMUM of 5 times with no incident or mention of his \"problematic\" tattoo. 2. Nowhere on the Sandbar website or Facebook Page can I find any - and I'm quoting Aron, the manager VERBATIM - mention of this \"Corporate Policy\". 3. Other patrons had visible tattoos on their arms, legs, backs, etc and yet a man with his wife's name on his neck was turned away - AFTER being a loyal patron for several years! Hmmm THAT'S ODD. This, in my opinion, is a BLATANT discrimination. Perhaps when you visit, they'll find something about YOU that they deem \"unacceptable\" - maybe you dye your hair, OR you wear colored contacts, OR have a religious affiliation they don't have room for... Whatever it is - whether you have tattoos or not (I have none by the way) - I would NEVER RECOMMEND GIVING YOUR HARD EARNED $$$ TO AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT SO BLATANTLY DISCRIMINATES AND DISRESPECTS FORMER, LOYAL PATRONS . It's despicable. And there are MANY, MANY other great bars withBETTER FOOD and BETTER SERVICE on State Street and in Santa Barbara. Please don't patronize businesses who have no problem reverting back to an era of having to fight for civil rights and liberties.", "So disappointed. I bought 1 vodka redbull and a cider and it was $18!!! There are places that will give you a much better deal. They actual charged me for the well drink and a $3 additional to add the red bull. Bullshit. It had nice music and it looks pretty clean. Go to another bar to save you money.   Yuppies... You are the people they are looking for here\n\n\nAlso, take the time to read the other reviews. The rep from the restaurant is full of it. It's almost like his replies are a joke. Clearly he isn't actually doing anything to fix these problems. Don't waste your time here. I don't want my money going to a dishonest business that doesn't take customer service seriously.", "I usually don't like to leave bad reviews, but I don't want anyone else to waste their bachelorette party & money like I did. I REPEAT! BACHELORETTES BEWARE!\n\nI recently had my bachelorette party at Sandbar. I came up from San Diego, and had friends fly in from all over the country, from New York and Florida, for the weekend.  I wish we would have had dinner and left. The food & our waitress were phenomenal, and the atmosphere is pretty cool, but I wish we didn't waste so much time there. \n\nMy night started off on a bad note before we even got there, because promoter contacted me offering me a free bottle of champagne in their \"VIP\" booth after our dinner... Yes, its true. They offered me the exact same \"Bottle Service\" package that I had ALREADY paid for, for free.  I can't believe they didn't comp it. I should have known to just leave after dinner, and only waste my money.. not my time too. \n\nI paid $100 for the lowest tier of \"bottle service\" which is false advertisement, due to the lack of actual service. After getting seated for \"bottle service\" at 10:30, we didn't actually get any booze at our table until after 11:00, only because I went & asked where it was.  I have no clue what our server was paying attention to, but it wasn't us. The \"bottle service\" should have come with one bottle of Chandon & a round of Jell-O Shots. The week prior, I asked the coordinator if we could swap the round of jello shots with a round of champagne, since jello shots aren't really my style, and she agreed, with the understanding that the \"round\" of champagne would be of a \"lower quality\" than the Chandon. Thats fine with me, I'm not picky about my bubbles. I also requested a cute non-alcholoic drink for my pregnant sister so she didn't feel left out. We ended up recieving one bottle of champagne, no extra round of champagne, and no jello shots (and no cute drink for my sister). Out of irony, my friend bought jello shots to \"lighten\" the mood since things were going so down hill. I had planned this party for months, and it was crashing and burning. \n\nI was told there would be \"decorations\" at our table, The decorations consisted of 3 deflated balloons, 4 rubber bracelets (for 8 of us) and half a feather boa. Im not even kidding, the boa was cut in half, you could tell because it was really short, and the cut end was shedding feathers like crazy. I was also told that our table would be in a \"private\" area, but they were seating people up in the raised area with us to eat dinner. Come one! Come All! \n\nOnce I alerted an employee that we didn't even have booze at our table, he brought us two bottles \"on the house\" that were on the menu for $18 each. I think they were non alcoholic. Both were immediately opened by an employee which was lame because we weren't going to put down two bottles ASAP, so the second bottle was just open, losing its bubble. Sad. \n\nOur \"real\" server must have been alerted that we didn't receive our \"real\" bottle and brought the Chandon shortly after. She also went to open the bottle, but I stopped her and pointed at the 2 open bottles already sitting on the table. She had already taken the cage off, and she ACTUALLY handed me the cage, and set the bottle in the ice bucket pointed right at the face of my pregnant sister. Seriously. Loaded champagne bottle, no cage, to the face. I can't believe she didn't bring us a new bottle, and I really can't believe she tipped it at someones face with no cage. \n\nSince we were thankfully sober from drinking only $18 bottle champagne, we realized her mistake immediatly and pointed it upwards.. I tried my best to re-attach the cage by twisting it on, but it unsurprisingly popped off within 10 minutes, which was the most exciting thing that happened all night. I gave this review one star because nobody lost an eye.\n\nBy then we were all suffering from serious buzzkill and decided to go dance on the smallest dance floor in the world. Advertising as a \"night club\" is misleading. My friend requested the artist \"Future\" and the DJ actually told her \"we don't play ghetto music\" which is appalling and to be honest, quite racist. \n\nI could tell my friends wanted to leave because it was just awkward, and we couldn't shake the buzzkill. We asked around and decided to leave to a place called Wild Cat that sounded pretty fun. The place was kind of seedy, but a much needed dose of humor after wasting almost the whole night at Sandbar. I wish I was able to leave a better review, but our few hours at Sandbar was the black mark on our trip. I might go back for dinner, but do not recommend that anyone way pay extra for their rip-off \"service\".", "Very good food, huge portions.  The service was great.", "WHAT A GREAT PLACE~~~~!!! The food is consistently good.. very high quality.. particularly because you can make a case that this is a tourist trap location... on State ST.. and all.. but we have been going here since it opened several years ago and have yet to not be completely happy!!!! GREAT PLACE, NICE EMPLOYEES, GREAT FOOD, GREAT DRINK.. GREAT ATMOSPHERE.... I HIGHLY recommend it.", "This place is horrible. Service is just the worst. If your in SB go somewhere else. Had a group of 6 people that asked us to move from our table and then had no table for us. We came for dinner and drinks and the staff was rude and honestly with so many choices in Santa Barbara, why go to a place that has zero customer service.", "I am visiting from out of town and was excited to stop by this bar after dinner. However, the bouncer looked at my ID and told me that the only way I would get it back was from a police officer and that using a fake ID was a felony charge. I am 25 years old. Ive never had anything like this happen and am completely appalled by their rudeness and complete lack of respect.", "Took my wife to Sandbar like I always do every other week. and the food as always a perfect 10! had the Asada Salsa plate 2 words pure perfection! SHANNON YOU ARE THE BEST!!!! my wife and I have been coming to Sandbar for many years for dinner but last night our waitress Shannon ROCKED! She has been our waitress on 4 occasions. She was very attentive, pleasant even though some customers weren't very nice she never stopped smiling. Thank you Sandbar Thank you Shannon and good luck ;)", "This place is fantastic! The vibe is very inviting and gets you energized! Came here for my 21st birthday, compliments of Mr. Brandon Alt who made the whole night go soo smoothly. Everything from drinks to a bandaid that I desperately needed! My crew and I felt sincerely taken care of. Definitely will be a repeat customer!", "Made a random stop here during a trip to Santa Barbara in November. Amazing food, great service, and awesome decor", "I ate there tuesday for lunch i ordered an enchilada plate. Within 5 minutes i had my meal. You might say good service, however, i have worked in hospitality for a few years and i know my meal was not fresh, and it was not brought up to the right temp. However, i gave it a shot knowing better. Turned out i was right, i have been sick for 3 days. That was the last thing i was able to eat, so thanks sandbar. Hopefully you will start cooking properly", "We are from out-of-town and were looking for something fun to do on a Wednesday night. One of the local tasting rooms recommended Sandbar for their reggae night. We had already eaten, so this review is only based on the cocktails and atmosphere. The band was fun and the half indoor/half outdoor ambiance was really cool. The staff was all super friendly and helped make my roommate's birthday great, especially Jamie! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!", "Flies!!! Read \"not recommended reviews\". I wish I had. \n\nYay I love flies drinking my water and on my food. Really bad service and food had no flavor. Could not not not get any salsa. No flavor in the food just really a waste of time and money. Margarita was weak. Beef burrito was gummy. No spices.  Beer was good. If this place did not have outdoor seating would not have gone. Is that all it takes to stay in business here?  I would also say that boyfriend had chicken tacos with \"homemade tortillas\".  He was not impressed.  I make better chile sauce with dried ancho and pasilla chilies from the local store.  Oh well.", "Came while my husband and I were visiting Santa Barbara and this place was amazing!! Food was great and happy hour was definitely well worth it!", "I typically end up here on the weekends, it's always a good time! I love sitting around the firepit drinking margaritas with friends! They also have an awesome breakfast deal!", "Usually we head to casa blanca for Sunday brunch, but last week we gave sandbar a try. It's a crazy good deal with food and a drink for under $10. My mimosa was good, but my friend's bloody mary was awesome! Definitely going back!", "Hit sandbar to celebrate a friend's newly single status. Perfect margaritas and tequila shots got us in a good place. Only bummer was we went out after the kitchen closed. Had to get our drunk food elsewhere. But good drinks and good music topped off with hot ladies galore!", "This place has awesome patio seating! It's a great place to grab a drink and watch people on State St! The ceviche is great and I think they make their own salsa. Their drinks have definitely gotten way better over the last couple years, and I recommend the margaritas!", "Dustin was a great server ! Continuously checked up on us and refilled our drinks! Sandbar has excellent service! Highly recommend Sandbar!", "Great find, excellent service... and the chips and salsa...  totally worth the drive from anywhere.", "Don't go here. We were seated for like 10 minutes and no one even came by our table. We went up to the hostess and asked if we were going to get any service, and 5 minutes later still no one came by. We got up and left. Don't support a restaurant that has such horrible customer service.", "Bad attitudes all around. Don't recommend at all. Stay away. Why would you need to provide a driver's license and your credit card to sit down to have food? I don't trust anyone to have my info unattended (home billing info and my cc #). Bad policy by owner which bartender told me - \"not my rules\". Took my drink order then went to text after pouring my drink... I watched my drink sit there' tic toc, tic toc until he was finished with his personal business. Goodnight. I opted to pay cash and left. I just should have left...", "Good food. Great atmosphere. Really nice staff. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town!", "Arthur the manager and his team handled our large party with ease! Fifty or so people and we were graciously accommodated and the food was tasty! I had the fajitas and they are very good. The atmosphere is perfect for a celebration. Lots of great seating areas, and plenty of televisions in the bar and back area. The servers were excellent as well. It's the type of restaurant where you don't necessarily need your specific server to get assistance. Anyone is happy to help. Another bonus is that we were given our check by table. So I was at a table with 3 others and we only had to be concerned with our own bill. Lastly, we spent lots of time taking photos and more than once we were in the way of servers coming to and from the kitchen. They would wait for us to get the picture before walking past. So nice!", "The food was really good I got the fried shrimp tacos and that sauce was to die for. I also tried the carne asada tacos but they weren't as good. The waiters were so nice and it really is a great place to eat.", "The food here is fire. Situated between two buildings on lower State St., Sandbar is a restaurant/cantina which morphs into a club at night. Great for dinner, drinks, and birthdays! The space isn't large but there's lots of seating, some cool fire pits, and great atmosphere. If you want some value in terms of drinks, grab a \"Blackout Beach\" and split that thing with 2-3 people. The bar can be a bit crammed, but that's part of the charm.", "Came in tonight for late night drinks and the bar was super busy and Brandon the bartender went out of his way to make sure me and my group of friends were taken care of! Excellent service and awesome lounge atmosphere in Santa Barbara... I will recommend it to all my friends. We were\nStarving and they got our last minute food order in of nachos which were amazing... Must try!!!", "I usually do not go to bars, but we decided to give this one a try! Our waitress Lillian gave her recommendations and gave us great service! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, talkative, and attentive. Had a nice small dinner with no complains.", "RICH is the bomb. He is the most personable bartender who has ever served us. He was tentative and made sure our drink were always full. He is a bartender that makes you feel like you have known him for years", "Sandbar is amazing. Was in Santa Barbara for a Sales Meeting and it's the only place our Sale Staff wanted to go on a very competitive State Street. The drinks were good, music was great (coming from a DJ/Music snob), service was great, Management (Art) was the best part. Great place to check out for a good time in Santa Barbara. You'll love it.", "Great food, nice selection of margaritas - all made with fresh squeezed lime juice - with a cool, casual vibe. Lillian is an awesome server - fast and friendly with a great sense of humor. \n\nThis is my favorite State Street restaurant. If you're feeling Mexican, this is the place to be.", "I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Normally, I avoid Mexican restaurants because let's face it, if I want good Mexican food, I'll stay home and cook. However, when I walked by, the hacienda style structure caught my eyes and the food that was served on the patio looked delish.  I decided to take a chance and check it out.  Dang....I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the Sandbar Margarita.  It was perfectly made.  Not weak at all.  The chips and salsa are sooo flavorful.  The salsa had a medium heat and full of tasty spices. Two for two so far. I decided to order the cilantro lime carne tacos.  Oh man!!  The homemade tortilla was thick and delicious.  The meat was seasoned to perfectios and was tender and juicy.  The cabbage and jalepe\u00f1o mix was a perfect topping. The service was extremely friendly.  I will definitely return and next time I might also check out the evening DJ/Dancing.", "Love this place. My group of 8 came for happy hour. Chelsea our waitress was awesome.  She was very friendly and patient with our group.  The food was awesome and so were the drinks. Every one was more than happy with our service and food. Definitely coming back.", "Great atmosphere but disgusting dirty wine glasses. We sent back a drink in a dirty glass and it was re-served in a wiped out dirty glass. If something that simple is very wrong how is the food?", "Slow, unprofessional, and not qualified to check IDs. Never been treated so poorly.  Would not recommend.", "The happy hour here is really great! Buy one drink and get the second for 25 cents. My bartender Jeremy took really great care of me and told me about reggae nights on Wednesdays. I came back Wednesday night and the band was really fun.", "Best restaurant and bar on State Street.  Excellent service, thank you Lillian, food, and ambiance.  First time visited for dinner.  The new remodel makes for a cozier and warmer feeling.  \nOur server was absolutely the best.  Lillian knew the menu backwards and forwards, was extremely attentive, and we loved the entire experience!!\n\nDefinitely will recommend to friends and family, and come back soon myself!!!", "Food poisoning!!! Had happy hour chips, quac, salsa and a beer. We instantly recognized that the salsa tasted weird. I said hmm... I can't pinpoint what it is - maybe it's seasoning/style. Hubby said no way, I'm not eating that. I stopped too, we mainly wanted the quac anyways. Well as soon as we get back to the hotel all horrendous and unpleasant things related to food poisoning happened to me!!! Hubby has a stomach made of steal, I guess, because we ate all the same things!! I might have had a few more bites of salsa than he did. Definitely gross!!! They used tons of gross seasonings to hide the fact that they are either using old and leftover salsa or they are using old rotten unwashed tomatoes. Maybe it's been sitting out, who knows!!!\nShould have told the waiter that the salsa tasted funny at the restaurant..now I've learned my lesson the most unpleasant and hard way!", "If I could give this place less than a star, I would. From the time my friend and I arrived until the second we left, our experience was ridiculously awful. The person whom initially seated was seemed annoyed and dismissive. We glanced at the menu and asked each other if we wanted to still eat here, and we settled. My friend ordered the slow braised beef sandwich, and I ordered the Mahi sandwich. We took a bite of our sandwiches and were both not pleased. Her sandwich was very messy, and we couldn't for the life of us get our server's attention to get any napkins or a refill of water. Her beef sandwich had absolutely no flavor but the salt that was dumped onto the beef. My mahi sandwich was very similar, no flavor at all. There was also almost no fish in this sandwich, just a bunch of flavorless fillings and a bun. Our server hardly ever came to check on us, and when we decided to try to salvage the super disappointing meal with dessert, the person who came and took our full plates away asked, \"So, how was everything?\" We told him \"Eh, not very good\", and all he said was \"I'm sorry\" and walked away. What was the use of asking? Was there anything you could've done to salvage our meal/experience at all? The dessert was fine, but didn't make up for anything. When our server came and gave us the bill, she didn't even bother to ask how everything was. We figured it probably wouldn't matter anyway, since they'd just apologize, dismiss you, and not try to assist you at all. My friend and I walked away very upset, unsatisfied, and once we got home, feeling rather sick, from the very little we ate. Most disappointing $20 I've spent. I don't recommend this place to anyone who enjoys to go out to eat a decent meal and have at least sub-par service.", "Fun ambiance with great music, comfortable seating, great food and great service.  Our server, Lillian was awesome!  The prices match the quality of the food.  Despite being a more Adult place, they were very kid friendly!", "Sandbar was a complete surprise. A friend took me there and I expected the typical bar food Mexican restaurant, with bad drinks, bad food and bad service! HOWEVER, Sandbar was just the opposite!!! When we arrived around 6 the place was busy but we still got a perfect outdoor table. As soon as we were settled our server, Lilian took our drink order and in minutes were sipping a delicious Margarita and munching on warm tortilla chip and a spicy guacamole. Lillian was incredibly attentive and answered our questions about the menu. I was particular, as I've had so many bad Mexican meals that sound good but have no flavor. I settled on the faitas and my friend got a burrito platter. The food came quickly and my fajitas, with peppers, onions juicy chicken came on a sizzling platter with plenty of tortillas. Again Lillian was right there to make sure everything was good. Have you ever kept eating because it tasted so good even though you were full? That was me...stuffed and still eating. We had another Margarita and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Great vibe, great service, and great food. Perfect!!", "Stopped in for happy hour!!! Best service!!! Best margaritas !!!! Best salsa....didn't ever have to ask for more... He just kept it coming...!!! Cra how good this place is!!!", "Had a great time tonight at sandbar, waitress was great and very friendly (brunette with red flower in hair). Our appetizer was the hand rolled taquitos which were awesome! I had the taco, enchiladas combo platter everything was tasty, girlfriend had a burrito which was great too. Pretty fun atmosphere, everyone in a good mood, I recommend.", "Great place for Happy Hour!  Service was awesome on a busy Thursday night!  Try it out.", "My wife and I spent 5 days in Santa Barbara for a friends wedding. We ate out nearly every meal and Sandbar was one of our favorites. The Sunday brunch special was a great deal. Around $8 for a large portion of delicious French toast and sides. It also included a very tasty mango mimosa. We also ordered the fajitas. In my opinion some of the best I've ever had! To top it all off, we had excellent service provided by our waitress Lillian! She was more than hospitable and made our experience outstanding. We will definitely be back on our next visit!", "Used to be one of my favorite lunch spots until the hostess rudely asked my friend and I to leave AFTER she had already seated us (we are both 20) on St. Patrick's Day around 3 pm. We felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome, as the hostess awkwardly stared us down until we left and handled the situation in such an unprofessional manner. After asking if the other restaurants on State had this same policy, she simply shrugged and told us I don't know and to walk \"that way\" and find something else as she then proceeded to stand and watch silently as we tried to leave with some dignity.  Had she have explained in a kind manner that St. Patrick's Day was the exception to their allowing under 21s to dine, we would not have been so upset. We will never go back again.", "So came to SB to visit for the weekend and ended up at this place 3 times in 2 days. Fun place to go out with friends and the food was good too! The manager Art, was also great he made sure we were all doing alright and having a great time! Extremely courteous and professional! Will definitely be coming back here again!", "Had the best bachelorette weekend at Sandbar! Jason Shotts and Arthur took care of my girls with a smile on their faces! Thanks for the hangover!! A must stop in Santa Barbara!!", "If there was a lower rating than one star I would give Sandbar it. My friends and I, a group of 20, went to Sandbar this past Saturday and had a terrible experience. As soon as we walked in a few of us sat down, and some went to the bar. The ones that sat at a table did not get served until about 10 minutes of waiting. As soon as our server came up she had one of our friends kicked out immediately with no explanation, and did not even ask any of us for drink orders. I went to the bar and the bartender was not friendly to me either, and multiple friends felt the same tension from the associates as well. Before we left a friend and I wanted to speak to the manager to let him know how we felt and how we were mistreated. The manager completely disregarded everything we said and did not apologize once. The bartender later apologized to me and my friends when we had left, which was a nice gesture and I appreciate it. But honestly I will never go back to Sandbar and give them my service.", "My first time at sandbar and my experience was awesome, we were greeted as soon as we walked in... Right after they sat us Chelsea took our order she was very prompt with our drinks and taking our order... Great hospitality from Chelsea. Food  recommendations were awesome. Great Ambiance. Defiantly coming back.", "Loved this place!  Service was super friendly (and good-looking) and the place itself was very cool. I liked the atmosphere and the food was delicious as well. I got the cilantro lime carne tacos and they were sooooo good. The tortillas were homemade and the salsa was yummy! My friend got a burrito, which was huge. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dinner out and some good Mexican food.", "Had an incredible time at this place, three nights in a row! Brandon, the bartender really took care of our bachelorette party! Drinks were delicious and kept us motivated all night! Thanks Brandon!", "Fantastic breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Best deal is breakfast. Sat and Sun 7.50 for brunch. 9-11am only", "I liked this place a lot last time we visited Santa Barbara. But this time I was told no entry because I wore a tank top. Hmmm... a beach town Mexican cantina and it's 80 degrees out. And a no-tank dress code. Sorry Sanbar. Uno star.", "A hip place to go when you visit Santa Barbara. After a great day at the beach it's time to party on State Street. A cool bar to hang out. Good music and even better scenery. Not too bad!", "Great place to kick back and have a meal with a beverage. Aw some atmosphere and wonderful staff.", "I'm from Carlsbad, CA and visit SB at least once a month. THIS IS MY GO TO PLACE!!! I mean what's not to like?? Atmosphere is so cool and chill. Then you have amazing drinks to choose from or ask JASON to whip up something special. The food is always consistent and delicious with large portions and low prices. Service is always great!!\nHuge S/O to the management for doing such a great job running the restaurant!!", "Went to Sandbar last night for a bachelorette party and had the best time! Arthur and the rest of the staff went above and beyond for us, giving us free champagne and a free \"special shot\" for the bride-to-be. The DJ was on point and seemed to be very good at feeling out the crowd and playing music to suit the audience. Great mix of new and old. Can't speak more highly about this place- go there!!!!", "As someone who travels for a living, I'm a huge fan of the outdoor atmosphere and the friendly staff. I also like that they support the local animal shelters with a drink special that gives proceeds to them!", "I can not ever go to State St. without hitting up Sandbar! Yesterday, we celebrated my cousin's 21st birthday. Despite roaming the streets of SB on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, we were seated right away, and had top of the line service. A few girl's ordered house margaritas and were very pleased. My choice of drink was a Bloody Mary, and it was delicious. Mr. Jason Shotts took care of us that afternoon, and we were so pleased with our appetizers, drinks and the ambiance of the place. We love Sandbar, and can not wait for Summer Fiesta's!", "Took forever to get a beer and when the server finally came to give it to us she slammed it on the table like she was pissed we were here", "THE SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLY HORRIBLE. The WORST I have ever experienced in my life.\n\nMy girlfriend and I wanted Mexican food today. We took the negative service reviews on Yelp with a grain of salt and gave Sandbar a chance...\nWhat a mistake.\n\nWe were there for brunch. Got sat immediately and salsa with chips (some odd chili salt on the chips) came quickly. The waiter asked for our drink order pretty fast.... We NEVER saw him again! 15-20minutes later we still had not received our drinks. (Water and beer take a long time I guess.... Scarce commodities!!!)\n\nI cannot comment on the food as I would have died of malnutrition waiting for food!\n\nThis place needs new management!!!!", "Went here for Cinco De Mayo with some friends. They had circulated a flyer advertising $5 drinks. In fine red print, however, it said \"until we are packed\". The clause was vague and the place was lit by red light bulbs which made the print nearly impossible to read. I asked the bartender and she said the price changed at 9pm, which the flyer didn't say. A friend ordered drinks after me for $5 a piece. For how much business this place does you think they would learn to be more consistent. Don't cheat your customers...", "I LOVED the Enchiladas de Mariscos! Best dish I've had at a Mexican restaurant, and can't wait to go again!\n\nLillian was our server, and she was attentive and helpful!!", "Just finished a day at the SB zoo and decided to get a bite with my family, I might add that it was Mother's Day! They only had a few low tables that would accommodate us, being that we needed a high chair. The hostess was awesome and sat us as soon as one was available! The wait staff was super friendly and great! Service was fast and the food was really good! Good margaritas too!!! I thought that they might treat us second rate being that we were a family and this place was happening, but was very pleasantly surprised by how awesome they were!", "You can tell by my other reviews I'm sort of the Mexican food freak who has to review everything. It's becoming my second job because I love TACOS. They are my favorite food followed by enchiladas. Anyway, we decided to hit up this place because it was across the street from where the concert was going to be (The Struts rock!). I love the atmosphere- it's like a Zanzibar Moroccan Mexican Indiana Jones meets a Kardashian who has a baby with Julio Iglesias. The chips were awesome, and that's the mark of a great Mexican place. Warm and salted just perfectly-- and amazing salsa. So, I order a combo plate and it was to die for. The shredded beef was like cooked by God himself. The enchilada and sauce was so savory. Even the rice and beans were delicious. I saw a few comments/reviews below mine regarding the service. I will admit the service was so-so. She took forever getting us stuff, forgot a drink or two, took 20 minutes to process the check out. But, I enjoyed the food so much I was a little less bothered by it-- and it was also super busy that night. I'm coming back up here soon and I'll hit it up again. What a nice oasis!", "Ok. Monday afternoon and we were cruising state street after a lovely weekend in Santa Barbara and found this place. \n\nIt was a great find for what it is. Actually it was better then what we expected it to be! Amazing fish, Pescado Del Dia, and ceviche - we even love the free chips and salsa. The chips were thin and warm and lightly seasoned. The salsa is homemade, which is not what we expected when we discovered it. The staff was good, sweet natured and friendly. \n\nSitting out doors on state street - this is an exemplary Santa Barbara cantina with great tequila and probably really hops on the weekend!!!!! \n\nGreat happy hour from 3-7 pm Sunday through Friday.", "I love Sandbar, it's the perfect place to just chill and hang out with your friends while enjoying a drink or a meal. \n\nEvery Sunday from 9am to 11am they have the special brunch deal where you get an alcoholic drink + brunch entree for only 7.50$! Best brunch in town! Must check it out!", "Some friends and I strolled in, just wandering around downtown. And we ended up spending the entire day here! The bartenders are AMAZING! Especially Amanda- wow!!! She was welcoming, and had wonderful drink suggestions. I would definitely suggest coming here and ask for Amanda!", "My sister and I drove to Santa Barbara a couple weeks ago, to meet some friends for a mini vacay. On the last night we walked over to Sandbar. We had actually met the guy that was hosting , earlier  that evening, while we were having a drink at another nearby bar. His name was Shotts (I'm pretty sure that's his real name ) we had THE BEST TIME!  The bar staff (Art,Brandon and Gini) were so FUN and so attentive! We loved them and they made us feel like good friends. Thanks for the invite Shotts! We will be back in a couple months. We didn't get to try the restraunt because we had dinner earlier, but next we will. Thanks for a great ending to a great vacation!", "A seriously amazing 5 star review. From the hostess to the bartender to the combo platter including tacos, and enchiladas, delicious! Amazing mojito and even more amazing chips!  5 stars, a must! Amanda was our bartender and she was amazing!!!", "Love this place! !! Food is great, drinks are better!   and the waiters/hostess are all really nice and helpful!", "Always friendly service and great drinks. Come with an appetite! Great food. Nachos, tacos, ceviche and quinoa salad were all delicious. Great food , reasonable prices and a fun open environment with pleasant people.", "Oh yeahhhhhh sandbar! This place is dope! It's named after some sort of geographical location but I wouldn't really know cuz I never paid attention in geography class, cuz you know that fly ass honey Jessica b. Sat in front of me and I was straight peepin on her every single class. They made all the tables into a maze which is a fun way to try and make it to the bar. They also got a bunch of shit on fire outside idk how this place isn't burnt to a crisp yet. But I'm no pyrotechnician, at least not yet, I have my aspirations ;) (wink). Got the tag team Brandon and Paolo behind the bar slangin dem drinks boii straight crushin it. I swear I come in for those two\nLovely faces alone. If only they would combine their beard and fro. They got dopppppeeeeeee enchiladas with mole blanco which is short for chocolate. That's right son, chocolate enchiladas, ya heard me! Don't forget they blend Mojitos their which is pretty much the most insane thing I ever heard of, go get some, bartenders love making Mojitos and they love blending stuff too. Perfect score of 5/7 would get lost in the table maze again!", "This place is a blast! Came to Santa Barbara for the first time for a bachelorette party and spent our whole time at Sandbar. The hospitality of the employees was unbelievable and the DJ was on point! Every single employee went out of their way to make us feel special and taken care of. Special shout out to Shotts and Brandon behind the bar for our drinks, Arthur for more drinks and great service, the DJ for letting me play and everyone for letting us close it down!", "Had the chicken enchilada suizas here today and they were great! Jordan, Jaime, and Jeremy were all very helpful with my decision and I felt very welcomed here. They were very informative as well and reminded me of the happy hour, which I didn't realize was going on so I got 2 beers for the price of one! Fun environment and people here at sandbar.", "I've been extremely disappointed with food and bars in California so far.  I came across Sandbar last night and I was beyond impressed.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly (and attractive) and they seemed to really care about making sure I was getting everything I needed.\n\nI ordered the ceviche and it was amazing.  Everything was super fresh and delicious.  I had \"The Perfect Margarita\" and it was damn near perfect.  Prices were fair too!  \n\nDefinitely worth checking out!!", "Becoming a usual date night for my husband and I. Great customer service, very friendly, get seated pretty quickly and amazing Tacos!!", "Love this place. Always smells like fajitas in there. I'd check out the half Asian bartender J Shots, he likes to give massages while you eat and not in an awkward way.. The little guy behind the bar named Richie was quite amenable to my guy and girlfriends!", "Waited more than half an hour to get a drink tonight. I saw someone complain for the same thing and get kicked out and figured I should just leave too before I got angry and complained about the same thing.", "Came here for lunch and wasn't impressed. The tap beers were flat and and warm and the service sucked. Food was ok but i wouldn't go back expecting a good time. Overall its a bunch of kids from Isla Visa running the place that don't know what their doing or care.", "Came to Sandbar for dinner and drinks. Ended up staying all night. Food was pretty good. The drinks is what kept me here. Bartender Brandon kept making try new drinks all night. They got better and better every time. It's worth a try if your looking for good food, great drinks and great service on State Street. I'll be back Sandbar!", "We try to get here whenever in Santa Barbara.  A \"perfect\" margarita (or 3!) and shrimp tacos and you'll be jonesing for it soon after.  Miranda the hostess could not be a better representative of Sandbar!", "Sandbar is not only a great restaurant but the atmosphere is so much fun, Loved the whole vibe of the place. Kudo's to Levi. He was so helpful and just such a hard worker with a great attitude :).. Thanks Levi for making our experience there even better than we had expected!", "A hip place to go when you visit Santa Barbara. After a great day at the beach it's time to party on State Street. A cool bar to hang out. Good music and even better scenery. Brandon, Chris, Jason, and Jeremy keep my beer glass full every time.\n\nDid I mention the scenery???", "Our Happy Hour experience at Sandbar was delightful.  It started with Lauren's warm welcome. Our server, Lillian, was attentive engaging and laughed at all our stupid jokes. Overall it was a great experience. Thank you to Lauren and Lillian!", "Amazing service, great food, ample seating, awesome bar, and a dance floor -- What more could you ask for? We were visiting from the bay and Shotts was more than helpful in recommending some sites to see and Chelsea was the sweetest waitress we had the entire trip. Thank you for showing us a fun time. Can't wait to come back!", "Lillian was great, she really know the menu and all her recommendations were great. Playa burrito was amazing! Lillian was very patient with our large party (12 ppl), even offered some watermelon cubes to pacify our 1 yr old little monster. Great experience, great food, and great venue!", "One star for rude management! His name was Aaron and definitely should not be managing! Confrontational should not be your first and last impression of a restaurant. That's all I have to say about that.", "Had brunch here this morning and you can't beat the price. The bartender Brandon was great! Super attentive and never let our glasses get empty. Will definitely be returning", "Went today with my family and we had Lilian. She was AMAZING!! Super attentive and provided great service. Drink and food was delicious and came out promptly. We don't live in Santa Barbara, but we come out every once in a while. We will DEFINITELY return!", "Great for brunch. Sat outside. Really friendly service. Food is good, but portions on the smaller side. The carnitas Benedict was amazing!", "This is not an establishment I would visit. My fiancee and I wanted to make reservations because we are getting married in Santa Barbara and wanted to celebrate our night with great music and food according to the reviews. The issue: we do not drink. Just because we are non drinkers does not mean that we are not allowed to enjoy and spend out money on food and non alcoholic drinks. When I said that we are non drinkers-the emails to make reservations ceased. So because we are not the kind to get wasted and would rather be sober to enjoy our wonderful time in a city we have never been too and will be celebrating a moment in our history, our money isn't good enough for this business. OK fine, thank you for letting me know what you think about customers and I will make sure to enjoy Santa Barbara without this business. We made our reservation elsewhere.\n\nSandbar, discriminate much??", "We were just in town for the weekend for Father's Day and we did some shopping on state street and decided to stop in for happy hour. The service was ok, server forgot to put in our order of chicken strips but other than that we loved it! The patio was amazing and the horchata Pina colada was so so so yummy!! We will be back!", "They had my original review deleted for reporting my experience of racism.\n\nLong story short, they would have gotten 5 stars, but the service changed when two black guys joined our table. The servers and bartenders, who were once nice and courteous, started ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. \n\nThe food was good but not worth the expense of my dignity and belief in equality.", "Casual atmosphere. Great salsa, chips were slightly undercooked giving them a chewy constancy. Not sure if this is standard or just the batch we got. The Carnitas Benedict has ruined me for all other Benedicts, so amazing! My husband ordered the Papas Rajas Hash, they were pretty delicious too.", "We came by for dinner and me and my best friend had a great time. The food tasted  fresh and amazing. Our server Katie was really sweet and on point. She was very busy but she stayed attentive and took care of us. The manager Art checked on us and made sure our drinks were filled. I highly recommend this place!", "The staff is extremely unprofessional. I understand it's a sports bar type restaurant so the overall vibe is going to be more \"relaxed\" but my experience was unbelievable. \n\nI went to their happy hour with a friend and noticed we weren't getting the best service, i.e. it took over 10 minutes for our server to greet our table. We looked around and realized why - one server to eight tables. Clearly poor management and not the server's fault. Seeing that my friend and I both work in restaurants and have dealt with similar situations, we disregarded the poor service and proceeded to enjoy our time. \n\nThen at one point our server came up to us, holding back tears, telling us someone else was taking over our table because another employee told her we commented on her terrible service (which we didn't, we commented on the restaurant's poor management). No doubt it was the hostess who had been giving us dirty looks throughout our time there. \n\nAbsolutely unprofessional! We couldn't stand being there for even another second so we left and ended up giving a generous (25%) tip to assure that server she wasn't so bad and honestly, to keep her from crying more.\n\nSolution?\n1) Hire better hostesses who, instead of listening to guests's conversations creating drama, actually do their jobs. There were always people waiting to be seated when the place had only 8/25 tables sat.\n2) Train servers to conduct themselves professionally. Servers shouldn't be so easily offended. I've had some people say very rude things to me and NEVER has it occurred to me to approach the table in tears telling them how \"hurt\" I was. That was absolutely absurd and I've steered clear of Sandbar since then.", "I love the sandbar. This is just a great place to hang out and do some people watching, eat an appetizer or a full meal or just sit and have a beer or a soda and relax while friends can come and go and visit you if your local. You can either sit inside at the bar for communal conversation or out on the patio for a little shaded privacy or if you're like me you sit out along the sidewalk to get a little sunshine and do some people watching. The servers are always friendly and cute and the Decore has consistently changed over the years and is extremely comfy. I still remember back in the day when this was calypsos. The sandbar has come along way and I love what they're doing with it always. This is one of my local go to's when I just want to chill with a couple friends and chat.", "This is definitely my favorite place in Santa Barbara!! The food and drinks were both amazing. Alma was my server. She was amazing, knew the menu and could recommend a drink based on what I usually liked. I started off with the perfect margarita and let me tell you it was perfect!! I also tried the ceviche omg! This tasted amazing and I loved that there was a lot of fish! For my main meal I did the pollo adobo tacos yummy! The atmosphere was great. Everyone was so nice and friendly. I couldn't of asked for a better more enjoyable place to go to. It will for sure be go to place!", "I've been coming here for years and up until today I've never experienced such bad service and horrible attitude from the servers. We were a group of 4, got seated, ordered 3 beers, and some guacamole to start, after experiencing such disgusting attitude, we quickly finished up our drinks and asked for the check. Used to love this place when visiting from L. A. but after this experience, NEVER stepping foot here again.", "Where to begin? Not only is the sandbar is a great spot to have some drinks and delicious food (try the ceviche), but the bartenders are the most friendly in town!  Request Jason S.--he is the absolute greatest--and knows how to have a great time. He makes this place worthwhile", "Manager has no concept of customer service. Disrespectful and rude. As a local I will never return or recommend. Dropped $400 and had chairs removed from group by the manager. Enjoy at ur own risk. Severely disappointed and highly recommend another place.", "The black dude at the bar in the back over charged me for my drinks. He pocketed it too because i checked the orders and my $26 of cash for 2 drinks wasnt on the bill.", "Can you start by saying that the entire staff at this locaton was racist and very unprofessional?  I had some family in town from Iran and wanted to show them Santa Barbara, we went to this location based on all the yelp reviews they had. It was early and the place was not busy but we liked the big patio and figured lets give it a shot.. We walk up to the hostess, and 1st thing right off the bat she askes to look into my bag? when I gave her a confused look she stated \"that in light of recent events they are checking peoples bags\" ( or better my bag becuase no one else got checked!) Mind you this is a 70lb little girl who would have been blown over if I sneezed to hard...but I figured why not, I got a backpack with towels in it... she took a quick glance with out even moving the towels around to see if there was anythingn else in there...but I guess thats what happens when you have your hostess playing security guard... . so any way we get seated and then ignored and after about 20 minutes, I literally had to waive down the waitress... like I was directing airport traffic.. our waitress finally comes and asks if we want drinks...we went ahead and ordered drinks... I was even thinking about ordering her one too,  cuz she was so dry and rude... and looked like she needed a shot to get her out of her slump...well another 20 minutes goes by and finally we get our drinks, which were the most watered down garbage drinks I have ever had in my life... at that point I had already decided that we are out of here... and never coming back!", "Great Food!  Great service!\nDUSTIN. Was Awesome\nAsk for him when you go\n\nHe is Cute too\n\nAddy Walker", "They have THE best chile rellenos EVER!!  Great service, the food came so! The chicken me is awesome, my husband raved about the braised beef!", "Good was fantastic. Chile relleno was the best I have ever had. Service from bartenders was better than most.", "Good Foo Great service  Enjoyed sitting on outside patio.  Relaxing. Completely contentedly eating", "Love this place. Nelson is the best bartender. Fajitas are on point. Nightlife is awesome. Check out reggae night on Wed", "I can't believe you call this a Mexican restaurant the service is poor the food does not have any spice or season you whatsoever. What are the restaurant do you go to work when the main entr\u00e9e comes before the appetizer. They really need to do the homework on the Mexican food and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's hungry or has a taste for Mexican really disappointed.", "This saddens me.. WAS my favorite place but after today ill never be back.. to start the host had no personality,  our server heather which we only saw one time.  our drink order took WAY to long, a michelada and a mimosa.. with no apology afterwards either.. we both ordered Carnitas Benedict our normal order the greens were warm.. the worst part was listening to the bartender talk to other people with an upset tone mind you its only 945 am... about how she does not receive tips and tired of being shafted we heard this across the patio are whole entire meal... in the Past  I have written amazing  reviews about this place today will be my last visit", "Came in for brunch this morning and had a great experience with heather as our server! Had such a great time that we moved to the bar and had a ton of fun with Roxie and Royce and ended up staying all day. Overall great experience and definitely recommend heading over for some food and drinks!", "I've come months ago when I was in town. Tonight the bar was pretty good. Tonight Jeremy was amazing and made the recommendation to mix the mango margarita with some jalape\u00f1o. Perfect for those that love to some heat. He had some good recommendations for those that prefer it mild as well.", "My favorite spot on state st! I've been here dozens of times and I am always satisfied. Their burritos are the best! They have so many options. I love the presentation of their food as well. Their guac is so fresh and creamy. Their drinks always hit the spot. The decor is perfect especially for Santa Barbara. I love sitting by the fire pit when is colder outside. A must try for sb.", "Honestly can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and remembered my servers name. I've only been to sandbar twice but had multiple staff members help me each time. Chelsea, Heather, Abby, and Roxy absolutely made my experience and I look forward to coming back soon and being waited on by your fabulous staff. All of the girls were very knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding area, constantly checked up on my table and were genuinely friendly people. Overall, great experience!", "Let me just say that I LOVED this place. As a visitor from LA, I'm used to lots of typical Mexican food restaurants. But I stopped by Santa Barbara on my way to the bay, and I couldn't have been happier. First off, what a great setup. It's open and lively which was a nice pick me up for my trip. Secondly, the service was AMAZING! Our first server Heather greeted us in a timely manner, gave us great margarita recommendations. That Perfect Margarita was truly perfect! I love tart drinks. She has good taste! Then my server let me know she was going home, and Brandon took over, and he was just as amazing! He recommended the crispy chile relleno and enchilada, and it was so satisfying. The chile was over this really savory citrus sauce and I was impressed. Brandon came by in such a timely fashion, checked up on us, cleaned up, and made sure we were having a great time. We left happy and ready for the trip north.", "It's one of the most amazing places I have ever been too! I wish it was place like this in la!! It's very cool and chill atmosphere stylish interior and amaaaazing food! I loved sangria more than margarita from happy hour menu!! Delicious! Also shrimp quesadilla is out of this world as well! Love love love want to come back as soon as I can", "CRAZY good value for money and CRAZY good service from Lillian at Sandbar. The food was delicious and generously portioned. Breakfast burrito & pancakes (what an awesome combo!) was enough for 2 people! Plus 2 large mimosas and a coffee (with unlimited chips & salsa) made for a decadent brunch. This place is worth getting up early for!", "Wow.  Incredibly impressed.  The food was amazing but the service was truly incredible.  We got their names so that we could publicly thank Heather, Arthur, Lauren, and Luke for their amazing service.  They treated us like friends and guests and we left feeling full and very happy.  Our group of 9 all really appreciate it, so thanks to all 3 of you.  Next time we come to Santa Barbara I guarantee we'll be back.", "Nicholas is the best bartender here. The blended Miami vice is amazingly refreshing! I wish they could clone him to work 7 days a week. The fajitas are on point as well! Check out reggae night on weds!", "Came here yesterday for lunch and can't wait to go back!  There aren't too many places you get it all...great atmosphere, great food, and great service!\nAtmosphere: most of the seating is outside in a patio that looks out to State Street and is so nice on a summer day, trees, cool candle holders and lights hanging from strings. Very cool setting.\nService: I wish I remembered his name but he was so attentive and friendly. We never had to look for him, he was on top of it (without being pushy)\nFood: Chips were fresh and very good (had seasoning salt which I liked), salsa was also really good.  I had the chicken sandwich and my mom had the braised beef sandwich....both were amazing! \nWish we were able to go back later last night because they had a live reggae band play. I will definitely be making a trip from L.A. to come back here!", "This is my first time using yelp, but I had such a great experience at Sandbar I just had to make an account and share. I came here over the past weekend with a friend. It was extremely busy but we managed to snag a couple seats at the smaller bar in the back. My friend got a watermelon margarita, which she loved, and I ordered an old fashion. The bartender asked me how I wanted it and I told him traditional. He made it perfectly, which honestly surprised me being that it's a Mexican restaurant.  The bartender (Chris) seemed super busy but was extremely nice and helpful. He answered all of our questions, let us know the happy hour specials and gave us a run down on the most popular items. We split the fajitas; they were decent but not great. Still giving Sandbar 5 stars though because of how friendly and accommodating our bartender was. Its rare to walk into a crowded bar and be treated and attended to so well. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely be coming back!!", "This place is AMAZING! Went for the first time tonight and loved it- awesome atmosphere, yummy food and amazing service! I would highly recommend it- our server Christina was fabulous and so kind and helpful, the whole waitstaff with nice and accommodating! Try this place! Can't wait to go back.", "I went here yesterday for lunch and absolutely loved the place! We sat on the patio, the service was quick, the staff was extremely friendly and the food was so good!! I ordered the chicken enchilada and chiles rellenos plate with a jalape\u00f1o/ cucumber margarita. So, so good!!", "First experience was great. Second experience not so great. We came On Sunday, the day before Labor Day. They had happy hour menus out. We asked our server if we could wait till 3 to place happy hour and she replied \"we do not have happy hour because it's a holiday weekend.\" We called over the manger for clarification.. She rudely pulled out the menu and pointed to small print on the very  bottom of the menu (that you couldn't even see when the menu was in the holder) where it stated \" prices subject to change during holiday and special events.\"  She said they are \"corporate rules\" that no happy hour options occur on the the holiday weekend. Well the holiday didn't start until tomorrow. We aren't cheap. We will pay full price but think their menus should reflect their restaurant rules. Manger apologized and bought our table a round of drinks. (This didn't make up for her unprofessional behavior) Shortly after the DJ came up behind us and screamed \" you guys got a problem. It's memorial, I mean Labor Day weekend.\"  Inappropriate behavior coming from 30 year + man. He obviously had too much to drink during his shift... After he confronted us rudely he went to the bar and sipped his alcoholic beverage. Disappointment for sure considering this place is one of our favorite places in SB that we visit frequently. In summary, our server Chelsea was great.  \nSide note: as we were leaving the manger Katie pointed at a sign that stated \" because of the holiday weekend we will not be offering happy hour\" and then said \"just saying.\"  (Weird that the sign just appeared) certainly the sign was not present initially as patrons were entering.", "It was Santa Barbara Pride weekend and we needed last minute dinner reservations for 7 guests!  My friend Troy was able to reserve a table at Sandbar.  Great location right on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara.\n\nWe arrived to find the host and hostess asking some drunken customers to leave the restaurant!  I was really impressed with how they handled the situation and were able to be friendly while deescalating things.\n\nAfter they were out of the way... we checked in and inquired about a table on the front patio.  The staff quickly cleared the table and got us seated!  \n\nAll throughout dinner, not only the server, but the manager also continued to check on us.  Such friendly staff... even wished us a happy Pride weekend!  Food and drinks arrived promptly.  Everything was delicious.  Splitting the bill 7 ways?  No problem for them!\n\nThanks for an amazing dinner handsome Arthur, hottie Luke, and adorable Heather!", "The experience was great.  We only came in to get an ice tea and sat at the bar.   Jeremy who was serving at the bar was fantastic.   He asked us how we were, where we we from etc.   He was great.   Even offered us a coupon to come back for brunch, but said to us have a great stay if we don't come back.  Thanks for a great experience.", "Service is excellent had Heather as a waitress twice very efficient friendly and fun loving \n\nYou can tell that the manager on duty Art keeps his staff having fun and taking good care of the staff\n\nFood was very good had the enchilada and chile relleno with the queso fundido skillet appetizer \n\nMargaritas are also excellent", "We had a slight incident with the host but it was quickly resolved when the manager Art went above and beyond his duties to accommodate us. The food was delicious and our waitress Jenny was great!! We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends & we plan on returning soon!!! Thank you Sandbar and Art!!!! It truly was a pleasure!! #weekendsbirthday #crutch", "Sand bar is very popular bar in SB.  if you like a manageable crowed of people type of place this is great. \n\namazing margaritas and the food is also good. This place is best for the vibe fun and atmosphere. It's a very happening bar. \n\nOutside has a fire place which is fun to sit around and mingle with others. The tables outside also have heaters. \n\nIf your visiting and like to drink definitely go here.", "This is an awesome spot in SB!\n\nWe just loved the ambiance and decor of this really cool spot. Great for food, drinks or just to people watch. \n\nWe sat in the patio and enjoyed our afternoon having chips & salsa, drinks and a really big lunch. I ordered the chicken burrito combo that came with two sauces, rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious right down to the last bite!\n\nThe servers were amazing. They took care of our group without a single problem. I recommend making reservations because it is a popular place and you don't wanna miss out.", "Richie is the best bartender ever. And he is not too bad to look at. Just don't have him open an olive jar. Best time ever", "Best chili rellenos ever!. Crispy fried. Not baked and Soggy. Food was very good and authentic . Margaritas were just average. Kind of expensive for drinks. Awesome atmosphere inside and outside seating.", "Came here on a Sunday night for a friends wedding after party and had a BLAST. The music here is pretty on point as they play tons of hip hop throwbacks and pop hits. We got extra service because of our wedding situation including nachos and champagne. Super glad that we ended up at this spot because it was a perfect way to end the weekend :)", "This place is getting 5 stars from me not only because everything we order was excellent, but because of the excellent service we received! It started from the second we walked up. The host, and I wish I had the guys name, but he was working around 5pm this past Thursday night, was so sweet and kind and patient with my husband and I and our 2 babies!! Yeah, 2! It's rough going out to grab an adult dinner with a 3 year old and a 1 year old but the staff here made us feel welcome, like we weren't bothering anyone and find everything to accommodate our family. Our waitress, Heather was just as sweet and attentive. Thank you to everyone working here for being kind and patient with us and our little family and for some Excellent Mexican food!! Ps- we are from San Diego so I do feel like we've been exposed to delicious Mexican food and are qualified to categorize this place as such! lol", "Went there last weekend and had a great time! The food was great, and loved the chips and salsa! Very friendly staff and great seating. Will return in the future!", "Very bad service. Half of the tables were free but the hosts said there is 15 min wait time and when we seated at the bar to wait she said it's busy and we better leave phone number and she will give us a call when they have tables...", "Great food and atmosphere, turn into a night club at night. Love the patio seating with the beautiful laterns and fire pits. Had a great time and might be a stop for us the next time in Santa Barbara.", "We had a vary large group and this was a perfect place for unwinding.  Great appetizers, drinks, and we really enjoyed the music.  This is a very fun atmosphere! Can't wait to go back!", "What a joke. Went there with a group of five at 2 in the afternoon. Even tho there was a big open table out front we couldn't have it because we were only ordering drinks. Several tables open!  Then when the hostess said we could not bring our bottles of water with us?  Are you kidding me?  Buh-bye", "If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I've never been to a restaurant that I had to send back the water!!!\nI don't know how toilet water taste but, I'm assuming it tasted what I received last night! \nAlso, the margaritas were watered down! The only thing decent was the chips and salsa.", "My girlfriend and I drove to Santa Barbara for a concert this week and has the pleasure of eating dinner here before the show. It was recommended by our hotel concierge and SandBar did not disappoint! Our server Dustin did an exceptional job explaining the menu and even making recommendations. We will definitely be back and make recommendations to friends and family! Cheers.", "Great service, great value at breakfast, great outdoor seating, tasty!  Macadamia nut pancakes amazing! Salsa is killer! Loved it!", "Great place... good vibe... BUT - horrible service and weak drinks. Our server was a blonde bimbo who acted like she was doing us a favor,  and tried to ignore us. When I told her that the drinks were weak, she wanted $7 for an extra well shot... what a rip off!!  I don't know what the management is thinking, but good drinks and good service without the crappy attitude are PARAMOUNT!!! They will be receiving a call from us.", "We were here this past week as part of a road trip and boy did it deliver. Best guac I've had hands down (don't tell my girlfriend who makes a pretty mean one).  The enchiladas were also incredible.  The place has a really cool ambiance with string lights and heat lamps and bartenders are super friendly. Ours was named Mike, who was extremely engaging and was doing an excellent job taking care of customers on a pretty busy night. We stayed for about 4 hours and I would do it all over again!", "Door man was a bag of tools. Wouldn't accept my wife's Washington state ID or her military ID. Didn't ask for date of birth. We moved from washington to California. Whoever hired that moron should be fired.", "Sandbar is the best!! Run by Art who is the BOMB!! You would be hard-pressed to find a place more fun. Good and strong drinks. Great food. And the prices are fair. The atmosphere is always festive and fun. It is absolutely an industry favorite. And it's always a party at the sandbar!", "Tried to grab a drink and a bite to eat on NYE at 8 o'clock and they tried to charge $20 just to get in the door. There were a ton of open tables. If you're going to offer a full menu, don't expect to be able to charge a cover charge because it's a holiday! 4 parties including myself walked next door where they were happy to get our business.", "Came here for the weekend.......literally was here Friday Saturday and Sunday. We made friends with Art and he was so cool. We had a group of 18 and had so much fun. We hung out with a little person named Paul who we met on new years and my friend mal hooked up with this Arab guy she met. my friend zack ordered the carne asadadoo with the Reano and he said it was really good. The patron wasn't bad either. My friend Sam liked all the music the DJ played and my friend mar hooked up with the DJs girlfriend by the bar. At the end of the day it was great. Art was amazing and I would recommend the breakfast baritto.", "I go here quite a bit with friends when we have time.\n\nThe chicken tacos are amazing here. I love the mixed drinks as well. \n\nDenisse is such a charming host, but I barely ever see her! I need more Denisse in my life! :(", "Arthur Basehart is an amazing professional bartender that needs to be recognized for the work ethics and great example for his fellow associates.", "It's a joke. My husband and I came in on a Tuesday night... there's no one here and it's been at least 20 minutes if not more and we still wait for some knows of service. Don't waste your time!!!", "Food was delicious, drinks were strong and the atmosphere was fun! Made a reservation on open table and had no problem getting a table for our large group!!", "Enjoyed good Mexican food, friendly wait staff, and cozy, street-side seating between two heaters. The enchiladas mariscos pair nicely with Modelo Negro on tap. My wife had the pollo adobo tacos. Also delicious. We'll be back.", "Came here after a work meeting on a Monday evening.. Couldn't have been more of an excellent experience. Friendly hostess, fantastic bartender (thanks, Shotty!), delectable steak tacos,  and of course, a few nice drinks.\n\nThe drink a coworker and I shared was the Blackout Beach; nice way to kick off our happy hour. Everything was decently priced as well. Will be back in the future when in the area.", "My friend and I came for margaritas and appetizers, and were more than pleased with our decision. We ordered the fresh fruit muddled margaritas (strawberry), and they were delicious! They were recommended by the bartender, and did not disappoint. The chips and salsa were good--the chips had some seasoning on them to make them extra tasty. We ordered a chicken quesadilla as an app, and it was insanely good. We kept commenting that the chicken was probably the best quality that we'd had in a really long time. Definitely surprised us for a bar!\n\nWe sat at the actual bar inside, and the service was exceptional. It was a Saturday night on State Street, but the bartenders took everything in stride. They remembered orders, were super polite, and one bartender was even keeping an eye on people sitting at the tables. He would get on a Walkie talkie to let the servers know if it looked like they needed something. I'd definitely recommend this spot!", "I've been wanting to come here for the longest and I'm really happy I finally had a chance to experience this place! From the cool decor to the delicious chips and salsa, I was impressed from the start. I was with 2 of my co workers and they both ordered appetizers which were delicious as well and our drinks were all on happy hour prices (which made me extra happy). The bartender Jason, who goes by \"Shotts\", was so friendly and fun! Can't wait to be back in Santa Barbara so we can stop by this place again", "If you are looking for a happening restaurant with great food and an enthusiastic\nenergetic atmosphere, then The Sandbar is the place to go. Though I only came for food, as most restaurants close early in Santa Barbara, I was astounded by everything. Service was a bit slow, but the food was worth it. Be aware that it is not a cheap place to eat and drink. I recommend all to stop on by and give this place a try.", "Got here for a late dinner with my girlfriend, and the crowd was out of control. The bouncer was very rude to my girlfriend, and she even complained about him whispering something inappropriate in her ear. Yikes! Then little to our surprise we found a hair in our gauc. Overall my experience here was horrible to say the least. I will not be returning here, and hope the wall is built a bit North of this place.", "Really enjoyed the whole experience!\n\nOur server, Ali, went above-and-beyond, and definitely coming back!\n\nThe blended Mango Margarita was smooth yet strong, and their standard Margarita was just right, perfection; the food was amazing...\n\nHad the shredded beef Taco, chicken Machaca Enchilada Y Relleno . . . not heavily salted, loved the enormous amounts of cheese, and couldn't finish it all through one sitting, but had to take the rest home... Great for munchies later, as that totally happened!\n\nBoyfriend enjoyed his braised beef Enchilada too, he was jealous of my plate.\n\nThanks again, and looking forward to coming back!!!", "Always a great experience coming to Sandbar! \nThe service is impeccable, The food is spectacular :) Art the bar manager is the man! Always making sure my crew doesn't go thirsty!\nAaron the boss was able to handle a late request of 35 people! Even though they were packed when we got there; thus, they handled it to perfection!\nThis is why I always come back!\n\nThank you Aron and crew!", "Love this bar! Such a good happy hour and yummy food. Kory is the best bartender, he makes delicious drinks and is easy on the eyes too. You have to try his mojito, perfection.", "Loved this place so much! The bartender Mike was so helpful, just wish his beard was cleaned up a little bit.", "Ben and Mike made our experience so fun! The two of them are like a dynamic duo. We stopped in on a whim to have a margarita when we noticed the great atmosphere. We were greeted so warmly by these two guys, so we ended up staying for dinner. The drinks were great, and the food really hit the spot. An authentic California experience that was simple unforgettable. (mike or Ben: if you read this I left my # on the receipt )", "Awesome place !! Visiting Santa Barbara and happened to walk in. Only came for drinks and an appetizer. However we sure wish we had time to eat dinner! \n\nDrinks were great and our braised beef nachos were amazing!! Probably\nBest nachos I've ever had. And that's saying a lot.", "The Sandbar is outstanding! Wonderful restaurant and bar. Great entertainment. We were on a sales retreat and we took 20 of our peers to the bar and I left my credit card. I did not realize I had left it till I got home 100 miles away. I called the restaurant and the Mananger mailed it back to me the same day. I can not give this place and it's staff enough accolades. Thank you so much.", "This establishment has extremely BAD service.  This is my daughters birthday and they couldn't accomadate our table wishes.  I would understand if they were busy but it was  2;30 in the afternoon and the place was mostly empty.

Our waiter was in training so I understand that our drinks were late, but still very good service. Good outside seating with a fire built into the table.", "Every time I've walked by, I've always felt \"Tourist trap, don't do it\" - Not sure why today was different. I mean Mexican food in SB is a dime a dozen and more often than not - the really \"trendy\" places are a raging disappointment.\n\nThe hostess mentioned that if we were cold to let her know and they'd be happy to turn the heaters on (it's in the 70's today but the section we were in was kinda drafty) and she even offered to hold our stroller for us.\n\nAliex is literally hands down one of the top 5 best servers I've had in SB. He was super attentive, great energy and kind. You can tell that he's passionate about what he does and truly enjoys it. He should give server training to literally every establishment in SB. The food could have been garbage and I'd still be stoked to have been there.\n\nThe food is NOT garbage btw - it was surprisingly different and tasty. I'm pretty confident that the steak for their nachos is braised in unicorn magic. It was unbelievably tender and flavorful and NOT salty (something hard to come by in SB).The burritos are incredibly large - I mean - enough to feed 2-3 people probably. He was also really nice about our odd food requests (usually servers get super annoyed - but it's hard to get kids to try something new).\n\nThe bussers were friendly - attentive and sincere. This was absolutely not the norm for SB. So glad we stopped in. Can't wait to go back again.", "This particular incident happened multiple weeks ago, but it's been weighing on my mind ever since. Two guys I met earlier in the night, who were both very respectful and genuine people, were not allowed in the bar. This was because the manager, a shorter gentleman with zero hair and a bad attitude, wouldn't allow them into the establishment. They were not drunk or acting in a disorderly manner at all and were very cordial. I can't stand when our vets get treated with disrespect and I hope this will be remedied in the future!!", "Great place to have drinks, food and watch sports. Outdoor seating next to fire pits to stay warm. Atmosphere is great and the waiter, servers and bartenders were very friendly. Highly recommend this place if you want to relax and have a couple drinks or food.", "About a  5-6 weeks ago I was driving up the coast from San Diego and made a pit stop at beautiful Santa Barbara. Walking up State Street I found this great looking restaurant to stop by for a margarita while I do some business work on my laptop. It was very early on a Thursday right after they opened so there was almost nobody there, which made the wifi work great.\n\nI had a cute little spot where I could people watch outside while enjoying my margarita, and because it wasn't busy I was able to chat with the host, Chris. I work in the pharmaceutical business in San Diego and didn't expect to talk with a restaurant host about cutting edge research done at the nearby university, I almost wanted to offer him a job on the spot for when he graduates! After enjoying the house margarita (which Chris said they make the mix in house), I wanted something a little more spicy and he recommended the diablo margarita with roasted jalapenos, and it may have been the best margarita I have ever had. I also tried the steak tacos, which may have no been the most authentic Mexican food, was still A+ food.\n\nI'll make sure to be back whenever I make this road trip again, unfortunately I couldn't make it on my way down.", "I booked a bachelorette party there for 10 on a Friday night.  I think something didn't get transcribed by the event coordinator since we arrived there and we weren't in the books, but I had a message from the event coordinator with the correct party details.  Initially, that a bump in the road, but they made up for it.  Got a seated right away, free drinks, boas, balloons, decorations, etc.  Jason was super accommodating and hooked it up.  He was our favorite person by the end of the night.  Their DJ was really good too.  Food was decent.  We would've gone back again on Saturday if we could.", "Kory was my bartender last and that guy was the best sooo helpful ! Made sure I had a great time and was always on top of grabbing drinks very little wait time. Highly recommend going to sandbar ask for kory !!", "Kory is amazing. Best Moscow mule I've ever had! Such great service. I will be coming back and recommending this place to my friends.", "My favorite place at Santa Barbara! The food is amazing and the Mango margarita is a must!!! Love coming here such a great vibe", "Best restaurant in Santa Barbara hands down....amazing mixed drinks....strawberry margarita and Bloody Mary's are the best....for brunch the Carnitas Benedict Croquette are the best for Sunday brunch....for lunch and dinner i always get the taco & Chile Relleno", "Both nights I was in Santa Barbara I found myself returning to the Sandbar. They had really delightful drinks, wonderful service, and a very cozy atmosphere. This was a great place for late night eats and drinks as well as an intimate setting for a dinner for two!", "Best restaurant and bar on State Street.  Excellent service, thank you Lillian, food, and ambiance.  First time visited for dinner.  The new remodel makes for a cozier and warmer feeling.  \nOur server was absolutely the best.  Lillian knew the menu backwards and forwards, was extremely attentive, and we loved the entire experience!!\n\nDefinitely will recommend to friends and family, and come back soon myself!!!\n\nWow, visited again on May 12, 2017 and once again this great place impressed all of our foursome.   We came in from a long and exhausting cycling trip.  Food, service, and value all spot on!!! Dustdin, was the key to making this an unforgettable visit.\n\nProbably visiting in the near future!!!\n\nThank you Dustdin!!!", "The best thing about this place is the comfy couches. Lazy service, even though it was so slow. Chicken was dry, drinks were sub par. Go to the funk zone instead.", "Wouldn't let our party of 4 in because my friend had baggy jeans.  Totally rediculous.  We were dressed nice and would have spent money.  Lame.", "My bachelorette party was amazing thanks to Sandbar and more specifically Jason Shotts ! The DJ was great playing a variety that had us dancing the whole night. Jason was such a gem hosting us 9 ladies that we returned Saturday night too (next night) and canceled our bottle service and reserved table at EoS to be at Sandbar. We'll be back to see you Jason ! Thanks", "I have never written a review on Yelp before but Jason Shotts at Sandbar has given us such IMPECCABLE service and attention for my girlfriend's bachelorette weekend that I can't help but write one. He was SO sweet, such a gentleman and took care of us for two nights!!! We definitely came back the second night after he was so nice to us. He even went out of his way to hold our coats for us in the back while we were dancing and gave us all water bottles at the end of the night and made sure we were all okay. The second night he reserved us a nice table around the fire pit and continued to be incredibly professional, polite and gave us superior service!! Will definitely come back again with more friends next time I'm in Santa Barbara! Thank You Jason!!!! You made my friend's bachelorette weekend and our night :)))))))))", "Sandbar was everything we could have asked for during our bachelorette fiesta! Jason really made sure we felt safe and secure but also showed us a great time!! The experience was so fantastic, both of our going-out nights were spent at Sandbar! Thanks to Jason and the Sandbar team for helping out our bride squad!!!", "Love this place!!! I was celebrating with a large group of girls over Memorial Day weekend. We checked out many other places along State Street and the Funk Zone, and this was the only venue that we returned to for a second time during the entire weekend. The music, vibe, and crowd was SO much better here than other places we were at (ex. Indocine and Tonic). \n\nHave to give a big shout out to Jason Shotts - he was a gentleman, and treated us so well!! He made sure we had a great time and were taken care of, and overall is really funny and friendly! Also he did things that were next-level, like making sure our belongings were safe and giving us plenty of water between our rounds of drinks. Plus, he makes a mean margarita. Highly recommend!", "Horrible experience.  The wrong food was brought to my table twice. We ordered guacamole and it was brought to our table twice.  We were brought the bill right after and told we were not being served because one of us was too drunk?  None of us were drunk. I will never come back to this establishment!", "They have a great happy hour from 3-7 Sunday-Friday. Buy one drink and get another for a quarter. (Wells, Calls, All Mexican Draft Beers, Domestic Drafts, and House Wines) $6.50 skinny margaritas and house margaritas!", "Disclaimer: This review is solely based on our attempt to get a table here & being turned away because we had a stroller.\n\nWent around 7:30pm on Saturday night, it was my husband & I & our 1 yr old in a stroller. We went up to the hostess & asked if they could accommodate a stroller, that we were willing to wait. She stuttered a bit & then said sorry we don't have a table right now. Never looked around & never asked any of the waiters. Unfortunately, it was quite clear that there were at least 4 open tables behind her, there was no wait & we were only being dismissed because she didn't want to deal with our stroller. \nDefinitely wouldn't recommend going here if you are looking to be treated respectfully.", "Terrible service. I had a reservation for my 21st birthday, and the waitress completely ignored my group for the night. She only came to our table to take our order and deliver the food. Never asked if we wanted more drinks or needed anything else. We gave them my birthday cake to light the candles; there were only 2 candles, a 2 and a 1. The waitress came out with only one candle lit and said she couldn't light the second one. My friend had to stop her, fixed the candle for her, and light it herself. Then when the check came, it was $400+, and the waitress didn't even give us the option to at least split it into 2, so one person had to front the huge bill. Highly disappointed, especially since it was my 21st birthday.", "Best strawberry mojito in Santa Barbara. Jeremy the bartender is great!! Food is good as well! Stop on you won't be disappointed!!", "Such friendly staff!! Tarra made us feel super at home and Roxie at the bar always has the best suggestions!! Good chips and guac, great vibes, and solid food. Def come", "Sandbar is the place to be. Tarra and Roxy are the sweetest and definitely made our night. Great vibes all around", "Tarrah is the sweetest! She took care of us and our graduate! If you guys come here, ask for her, you won't regret it!", "This place never disappoints. Try to snag a sidewalk table to watch the parade of locals, students, tourists and kooks walk by. Inside is also very fun and lively with a Cabo-like Fiesta feel. Staff is super friendly and helpful from the hostess at the front to all of the waitstaff and bar folk throughout. \n\nYour basket of chips arrives and there is no way to resist them. Light, crunchy and addicting. Almost anything on the menu is good and the portions are plentiful, big enough for sharing. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. Our only gripe is that the margaritas were light on the alcohol so maybe order a shot on the side to ensure their potency.", "I went here with a few friends on a Friday night and we didn't wait very long to get a table. The serving staff was delightful and quick to help us. I ordered a happy hour drink and a perfect margarita. Both met my expectation and were delicious. In addition, I ordered the fish tacos and they were gone before I knew it! The ambiance is terrific, especially the open windows connecting the inside dining room to the patio. I would definitely go there again, and probably will in the future.", "Always one of the stops i have to make while in Santa Barbara. Great drinks and a totally fun atmosphere. Today the bartender Chris was awesome. Totally helped with plans for the rest of the day, made great drinks, and had great conversation. The fresh fruit margaritas were amazing as well as the jalape\u00f1o margs. Will def be back before I leave town", "Excellent service. Great food. This is a family tradition every time we come out to Santa Barbara. Grateful for this spot and for Ben with his excellent customer service. Made the whole family feel comfortable.", "we tried to enter the restaurant at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night which was half empty and one of us had a USA basketball t-shirt on and they refused us entry cuz we were wearing a team shirt. Never heard anything so dumb as we are proud of the USA and we were ready to spend a bunch of money on drinjs and dinner. We will never go back.", "This is the first place I ate at in Santa Barbara and I keep coming back every time. It has an awesome atmosphere and a patio with a great view of State St. The host Celeste welcomed us in and managed to get us in right away even though it was a busy Saturday night. Great service and great food. Definitely recommend!!", "This is probably one the best place in Santa Barbara to hangout. I went there with friends and we sat outside to enjoy the atmosphere which is awesome, the food is delicious and margaritas are the best. The service is terrific and the staff is friendly and efficient, the first impression that we got was cheerful and pleasant: Willow, the host made us feel very welcomed and Ben, our server, was very friendly and attentive. I totally recommend this place!!", "Honestly, my boyfriend and I came here because it was happy hour which is buy and drink and get another for a quarter. \n\nI ordered a strawberry margarita and he got a double jack and coke. To be honest with you the strawberry margarita was disgusting!\n\nThey made me a house margarita with 6 mashed strawberries in the drink! Who or how does a bartender NOT know how to make a strawberry margarita?! How can one mess that up?! \n\nThe food was ehhh! It was not out of this world! \n\nI ordered enchiladas suizas with grilled corn and to say the least it was kinda bad! The corn was \"grilled\" not sure how many hours ago or days because it had a funny taste (just saying) but when I got mine it was cold! Like if they got it from the refrigerator and just slapped it on my plate! Nasty!\n\nThis place is what it is 3 stars! I never checked YELP before coming here! Wish I did and could've spent my money elsewhere like at EL TORITO! Lol \n\nThe food and drinks were as bad as their service and 3 star ratings combined!", "The fajitas was quite delicious!!!!  I enjoyed the strawberry margaritas!!  I definitely recommend.", "The waiters and service here is the absolute WORST you can imagine. We came in here to celebrate my wife's birthday and had a utterly\nDisappointing experience.\nThe waiter was rude and completely bored. Since we were a party of 14 I guess they knew we had to pay a 18% gratuity.. but they didn't put an ounce of effort to earn in. At one point the manager yelled at my friend for absolutely minuscule issue which was too much for us and we ended up leaving. \n\nI hate this restaurant because they lack basic civility.\nI would give them a zero rating for hospitality.. freaking idiots!", "Horrendous experience.\nCame to this place to celebrate a friends birthday and left very disappointed with the overall experience and hospitality. Some of us had stepped out for a minute and were returning back when one of the manager yelled at us for stepping back in from a different entrance. Complete lack of sense and no respect for the customer.\nDon't go here. There are better places :)", "Very rude and possibly racist management. Ignored us and shouted at us when a few of the trip decided to leave but come come back. The manager (short shaved head guy) does not have basic communication skills neither can he run a restaurant. We had a reservation for 12 and had 2 extra people join us. We were refused 2 chairs citing a fire hazard. Later, the same spot was filled with people after they converted it to a dance floor. After paying $500 + for dinner, we expected better service.", "Mexican food is my favorite and this was the best by far.. The environment was fun good delicious and great drinks... Can't wait to come back again.. Everything we ordered was wondeful", "My absolute favorite place to eat at in Santa Barbara! The food is delicious, they give you a great amount of food, the atmosphere is super fun, and the service is ALWAYS excellent. :)", "We come to SB twice per year and we visit The Sandbar at least twice each stay. We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The servers are friendly, the drinks are amazing, the appetizers are awesome and the food is fantastic!\n\nImagine our heartbreak when we arrived and found it temporarily closed.... AAAAGH! PLEASE open again soon Sandbar. We already miss you.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe Sandbar is open again and just as fantastic as before!  Keep up the fantastic work, Sandbar!", "Does anyone know why they're closed (temporarily) ?  Was on my way there this evening. Great place !!", "this place was horrible, we were served on chipped plates, really & the tacos were stone cold, we will never go back", "Great foods and drinks. Also super fast service, everything is brought to you within 15 minutes at most. \nFun weekend place", "Passed by on Friday evening and they said it was re-opening nite so we had to visit. Tasty burrito and chile relleno, good salsa and an energetic environment...what's not to like. Very reasonable prices leaves enough cash to buy more drinks...", "Husband and I shared the supreme burrito, it was delicious and filling. We sat at the bar and enjoyed just hanging out. We had beers, I also a had a raspberry mojito and my husband had a Cadillac margarita they both were great. We love this place when we visit Santa Barbara.", "Horrible host called \"tailor\" was a bad person, she didn't dress appropriate, is rude and uneducated.She asked me how many in my party then I said 4, at the moment I was with my 5 year old and myself, then she said when the other people come then I will give you a table and I said I came all the way from Granada Hills, she said so?..., and I said I'm tired and hungry can I sit down she said no!! Then I said ok give me a table for 2, then she said if I give you a table you cannot move to another table if the other people come, honestly I wanted to leave but I said I will eat and leave quick but no, they took forever and the seats were dirty,the ceviche had no flavor and no  lemon (the lemon tasted rotten and/or tasted like the lemon from the bottle) I asked the nice waitress for lemon and she took forever, (15 minutes) to bring them, then they were old and they tasted horrible, the ceviche was a small portion for $16 !!!! The guacamole was unseasoned. The lettuce in the Caesar salad was bitter and the entire salad had no taste. At the end of our experience there, I asked for napkins and the same girl tailor said \"we don't have napkins\" and I was confused as to why a restaurant does not carry napkins. She was very rude to me so I told the closest waiter what had happened. He gave me napkins and told me that he will notify the manager. It was extremely expensive and the service was horrible. I do not recommend this \"restaurant\" to anyone at all. I hope they fire that tailor", "When it comes to an overall great dining experience, Sandbar stands above the rest. \n\nLet's start with the drinks. They've got a large tequila section, but their margarita's homemade sweet/sour is what steals the show. They've got cocktails for every type of drinker, a nice selection of drafts (including local breweries), and some nice wines as well!\n\nThe food is awesome and full of flavor. The chips and salsa is addicting, so make sure you save room for dinner! My favorite menu item has to be the Enchilada Suizas. Enchiladas are my jam! If you're looking to share, get the fajitas. They're huge and coming out piping hot.\n\nThe service was friendly, fun, and great at what they do. Everyone seems like they are there to help. The bartender, Megan, was very attentive. She even helped me pick what to eat when I couldn't decide...there's so many options! \n\nIf you're looking for a place to party, Sandbar has an awesome night life. They seem to have a dj or live music every night!\n\nThey even have the placed decked out for the holidays! I love the giant Santa out front. This place has a lot of character!", "Food was awesome had the beef taco, cheese enchiladas and chilli Reno. Service was on point as well", "Two words: Unlimited chips.\n\nIn more words, this place is a happening and tasty joint. We went on Christmas Day and were greeted with the smell of margaritas and the comfort of lounge chairs, heaters, and traditional Mexican decor. The service was exceptional, the ambiance was fun, and the food was damn good (holy-guacamole-kind-of-good).", "Mariay represents the entire experience of family-fun- festivity!! Our niece turned 21 and Mariay created celebration for us!! We lost our home in the Thomas Fire - and Mariay created comfort for us - \nSandbar is a good place to come for relaxation and rebuilding the soul!!!", "Brought my parents there for a quick dinner. Food tastes good and service is great (given it was right before new year and they were so busy)! Our waiter (I didn't get his name, my bad) was patient and hustling. Good vibe, too!", "We came here today on New Years Day. Everything started off great. Food was great and our first round of Margaritas was wonderful. It was 3:05 pm and we went to order a happy hour drink (Happy hour every Sunday-Friday 3-7 pm) and we were told they weren't running happy hour today. They had the Happy hour menus on the table... advertising the deals and we were denied...so we left.  I would rather go pay full price for a drink somewhere else... it's the principle.", "I went to Sandbar with my Industry boys for the first time and Tarrah helped us out with our drinks. She was so friendly, and helpful and made the experience worth being there.

Definitely a must when you're in SB!!", "Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat, drink and hang out! Food is great and so is the happy hour! Friendly staff. Gini, one of my favorite bartenders always makes sure my friends and I have a great time when we go in!", "Good vibes and great customer service! Our server Dustin catered to our 18 person party like it was a daily routine. Never saw a water glass empty at any point! This place has good food and great service, will definitely be putting this on my list of top restaurants in Santa Barbara! Thank you sandbar for the wonderful experience for my family and friends.", "Great Happy Hour Sun-Fri! Buy a beer get one for 25 cents! Half off appetizers! Their regular menu is great as well. The combos on the back of the menu are huge and of quality ingredients!", "Was looking for a place to eat while visiting Santa Barbara with my boyfriend. Came across this place and I must say it was great. Aesthetically wise, it's appealing. Many chances for great photos and he way it's set up has a really cool vibe to it. Waitresses are nice. Were attentive and the food itself was delicious. I got the chicken machaca crispy taco and the cheese enchilada combo and I truly enjoyed it. My boyfriend got the grilled asada burrito and it was huge. He usually eats a lot but he got super full on just the burrito. We didn't get any alcoholic beverages but looking around me , many of their margaritas looked to die for. Would come again 10/10", "Great place to eat, drink and dance. I love the way they got their fire place set up.", "Justin returned our lost phone. Thank you so much!!! Maya is a great waitress. The staff accommodated my entire family quickly (party of 12 and a baby). Service was fantastic. Great place to eat on State St. We will definitely come back many times more.", "Great crowd. Awesome service, and delicious food. Cool artwork and loved the big TV screens.", "Went here with my family to have lunch.  Service was fast and friendly.  Went to use the restroom before we ate.  After about 15 minutes realized I didn't have my phone with me.  Went back to the restroom to see if it was where I had left it, and it was gone.  Asked Justin if they had found one and they promptly returned my phone.  Service was great, food was great and thanks to the staff and Justin for returning my phone.  Nice to see a restaurant that has great food, drinks and a staff with integrity. Will be come back again.", "We had a great experience at Sandbar. It was a perfect spot for a bite and cocktail on happy hour. Ryan was really helpful and patient with us. We had a very large group and he continued to check on us to make sure everything was to our liking and we didn't need anything else. Happy Hour for drinks was an excellent deal- one drink normal, one for a quarter. And a whole list of food options for half price! Definitely a spot to stop in when you're here(:", "Honestly, I don't usually come here because it's too busy, but industry night and happy hour is fire. Tarrah is so nice and really made the night.", "I've came here for over 5 years and within the last year coming here I've had a server by the name of Alex which has been the most attentive server I've ever had since I've been here.. I never post reviews at all, but when things need to be brought up from someone above and beyond doing their job, I will definitely go out of my way to make sure it's noticed and needed to be seen. Congrats Sandbar for hiring awesome servers.", "Went to the sandbar last night and had the most amazing time! The margaritas were delicious and the service was exceptional.

Good friendly service, good ambiance always a good time!!\n\nThis is always my go to place in santa Barbara.", "Stumbled upon this cool place while walking around and exploring the town. Immediately drawn in by the view of people having a good time. The food was delicious and the staff was attentive, but I like the overall decor and feel of the place. Didn't have any drinks, because had a long drive back to SF, but will certainly sample some tequila at my next visit!", "Came in on Saturday day with my family for some afternoon Mexican food. Ordered some burritos, tacos, and drinks. The sangria was delicious! Also want to shout out Alex and Katie! They provided us excellent service and made it a memorable experience for us!

Ryan was an excellent waiter and the food was delicious!", "Ryan was an awesome server, Sandbar had great food, excellent drinks, and a very fun happy hour!!", "Had a quick dinner at Sandbar before heading to the downtown farmer's market. The achiote chicken quesadilla was sooo good! The tortilla was crispy, and inside are delicious melty cheese and chicken... Mmmm! Also, the meal was very filling for me (took some left over home) despite that the price was surprisingly cheap (about $7). A very enjoyable experience here.", "This was a spur of the moment decision to go here after a run we finished in SB. It was a Saturday around 11am. It wasn't too crowded, the food was DELICIOUS, and service was great. The drinks were buy one get one for a quarter. The mango mimosa was really yummy and the mahi tacos were even yummier. Highly recommended!", "This hit the spot after a 3 hour drive coming into town from LA area. Staff is friendly and courtious. Happy hour was great. Get the vodka lemonade and the watermelon vodka, refreshing and it it tge spot. Outside is great to people watch.", "This place was nice until we got kicked out for no reason ? We were obviously 21 but the people next to us were barely 20 soooo maybe you guys should not kick out the ones older than 21 because we are legally there compared to the other guests there. Never coming back after we spent lots of money. Bye thanks for nothing !", "Great little place to eat! Love the vibe, had great/friendly service. The fish tacos were delicious! I also had a jalape\u00f1o margarita - they get high marks all around!", "While traveling in CA, and after a 7 mile hike on Channel Island, we had dinner here. Fun outdoor atmosphere with heaters for a chilly but beautiful Sat evening. Delicious seasoned chips with salsa brought almost immediately to our booth. Burritos and shrimp quesadillas were some of the best we've ever enjoyed.", "Super slow service. 20 minutes for an iced tea and a well drink. 1:40pm on a weekday.\nFood was subpar. Had the shrimp quesadilla. Shrimp had a weird, spongy texture like it wasn't cooked. \n Service speed was horrendous. This place is all hype, don't waste your time or money here.", "Loooove their chips and salsa, they have huge water and soda cups, amazing virgin frozen margaritas, and the best Chile rellenos and hard tacos.", "Came in for some lunch and the place was busy. Found a seat at the bar and ordered some food. Didn't take long for the food to come out, and it was really good.  Only thing better was the service, even while being busy Gini took great care of me.  I left satisfied and slightly buzzed. Good times", "I am relatively new to Santa Barbara and haven't been to many restaurants. A friend of mine came into town and we decided to have dinner out. Well, I'm so sad for my first experience taking her out we ended up at this place. We arrived and the hostess didn't acknowledge one of them asked \"how many?\" And then walked away. We were sat and were given chips and salsa and about 15 minutes later (after asking two other people for assistance) finally received service with the server never apologizing for not receiving service and stated \"they never told me you were my table\". His response was pitiful. I will never return to this establishment again. Horrible service and not worth it.", "This place is amazing! I had there tacos and they were absolutely delicious.  Great service, friendly staff and great environment. I highly recommend.  I live in LA and stop by to deliver a car for a client and had the best experience! Thank you Josh", "My friend Robin and party of four were not let in because one person had baggy jeans. Not the way to run a business let alone a club type of business. You won't be seeing any of my groups going there ever again.", "Came here with 5 other people, were seated immediately for dinner... which was the only positive point of the experience. Service took entirely too long - example: we hit the bottom of our chip bowl before we even received our waters. Drinks took almost 45 minutes to reach the table. Would have ordered more food / drinks, but we didn't want to wait another hour for service.\n\nHowever - the kicker was the end of the evening. My friend who paid the bill accidentally left her card in the check presenter. When she called to make sure it was there, it took 45 minutes to even get someone to pick up the phone. When they finally did, the gentleman on the phone said \"you know what, it's really busy and loud over here, you'll just have to come in tomorrow to see if it's here\".\n\nWish I could give zero stars for customer service. Try elsewhere.", "I usually go for the happy hour once or twice a week. All the bartenders are fantastic, but today Ginny (despite being a Georgia Dawgs fan) went above and beyond. She was training the new bartender and was being attentive to everyone's needs. Definitely going to be coming back.", "Came here on a Saturday night because we were starving and couldn't figure out what else to eat that wasn't about to close or didn't have a super long wait time.\n\nWhen I get carded I sometimes say, \"Oh! I'm glad you asked because I'm older than I look!\"\n\nSo when this kid carded me he looked at me all bug eyed and said, \"You are definitely older than you look!\" And then he said the same thing to my fiance!! LOL all I could do was laugh!\n\nFood: We were seated right away and given menus. I ordered the Soft Taco Asado ($15.49) which came with two soft tacos filled with cilantro marinated skirt steak, beans and rice. My fiance got the Chile Relleno and Taco ($12.25), which came with chicken machaca, beans, rice, of course the relleno, and pico de gallo. I also got the Strawberry Tropical Daiquiri ($10.75) with their \"superior rum\". \n\nIn simple terms the food and drink were forgettable. I didn't even bother taking pictures of it. The asada didn't seem like it had much of the cilantro and lime flavor it's named after. The Relleno was just alright, not the best. And the rice and beans are rice and beans!\n\nService: While I was waiting for our food, I was looking around at other tables that had chips and salsa. I asked another waiter if they were complimentary and he said they were and said he would get some. I never saw him again. Once our waiter walked by I asked him for some. He came back with some and then came back to bring us our food, then to drop off and pick up our check. But other than that I felt he was more interested in talking to the other servers and those ordering shots.\n\nAmbiance: It's pretty loud in this restaurant, so this isn't a good idea for a date night. Maybe just to have a drink and then go eat somewhere else. There's also some homeless guys who were yelling at everyone (we were seated outside).\n\nParking: Parking was found about a block away in a lot that was about $1.50 for two hours (super reasonable). \n\nThis place is definitely not for kids or any type of family and I won't be coming back if I'm in the area again.", "I have always had a good time at Sandbar! The food and drinks are delicious! Taco Tuesday for tacos and margaritas is always a great choice! The staff and service is great. Tarrah goes above an beyond - she is always so friendly and makes sure each guest has a great experience and feels taken care of. I love staying after dinner for a little dancing on the dance floor as well! Great ambiance!", "Sandbar is so lit, Tarrah is so much fun and so helpful she really adds to to the experience", "My favorite place with the best margaritas! Love Tarrah, super sweet! I recommend ordering the strawberry margarita and a tequila shot!", "Great food, excellent service, Tarrah is your go to if you want to have a super fun experience at sandbar!", "Tarrah is the best!!! Yummy drinks and sick dog videos. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you", "Amazing service from Tarrah and a great tequila sunrise! Will be coming back. Definitely join the birthday club- really great deals", "Used to love coming here because the music wasn't as shitty as everywhere else (I.e sharkeez, o'malley's) but it's literally shit music now. Wish they would stick to beats that non-white people would enjoy... aka not Jason derulo and Katy perry. \nTried to ask DJ nicely to change and now no one is dancing.... take a hint and read your audience", "Back at Sandbar Santa Barbara!  Came up a couple weeks ago for a wedding, had fun on State Street. Settled at Sandbar for dinner. Great staff people, manager brought over a heat lamp for us, which was great!  Stayed longer cause we were so comfortable. Good food, nice people, service great!  So, we are back for some great drinks and atmosphere. Yum!  Two five stars for each time we come!  We are hooked! My post is for Saturday night, just flipped out for some reason?", "The nachos here are the best I've ever had. During happy hour they are only 5 bucks. What makes them delicious is the seasoning they add to the chips. Also the pork carnitas tacos are sooooo good! Really recommend, the tortillas are so soft.", "Yuck!  Everything was terrible - the guacamole, the drinks, the entrees.  The service fast (get 'em and get 'em out) but that worked for us as we were anxious to leave after such a bad meal.", "Ryan was the most attentive waiter I have ever met. He was fun, knew the best insider menu and made our every dream come true. If you come, find Ryan. He'll literally light your fire, fill your glass and if you're nice, the salsa will flow", "This is one of my favorite places in town! Tarrah is amazing and always hooks it up! Best music and vibes!", "I am celebrating my 21st birthday and I was willing to pay $3 to just use the bathroom and they refused me. Don't come here, they are rude and disrespectful", "I brought my cousin here for her 21st birthday and we waited in line. My friend gave the worker at the line a compliment and he told her our group was no longer welcome. He was by far one of the rudest person I have ever met. If you want to have a good time, DO NOT COME HERE.", "Came here for the first time this week. Our server Lucia was very nice and helped us pick out the perfect entrees. Service was very quick and food was very good but bring your appetite! Burritos are huge!", "Tarrah is incredible. Friendly and welcomes everyone. I come to sandbar for her. She has awesome promotion for parties, easy to contact, and has great customer service. She makes Sandbar great! Thanks Tarrah!", "Sandbar has become our destination of choice for lunch when my group of friends visit Santa Barbara for our annual train ride.  I've enjoyed the shrimp tacos-TASTY! and the bean and cheese tostadas- very tasty and the corn tortillas are the best!  Now for the cocktails:  GET THE MANGO MARGARITA!!  It resembled a 7-11 Slurpee but for adults only.   I've been back twice since our May trip.", "Terrible experience. Clueless teenagers at the hostess stand told us to seat ourselves. We sat and asked several employees for drinks before we were so annoyed we left. Waste of time. Snarky teenagers at the hostess stand recommend sharkeez! Great recommendation, quick and great drinks ! !", "Rude teenagers working at the hostess stand.  We sat and waited and couldn't get service and left.  They seemed to think it was funny at the hostess stand and recommended we go across the street to Sharkeez.", "Great crowds, nice people. Delicious strawberry margaritas and flan.  Our new way of enjoying life is to start with dessert and a drink. The food is always great!  Salsa and chips to start out sets our mood!  But the flan, yum!", "Service not very attentive. Lucia did not know menu. Ordered a fajita salad and she brought me a salad of oily onions and bell peppers. She said did not come with chicken. When looked at menu it said explicitly that salad included chicken. Asked her to go ask manGe and credit. She did not come back for 10 minutes and when finally asked her she said the menu was wrong. Would never have ordered a vegetarian salad for 13.75. I would not recommend this place for the service and Lucia was horrible waitress!!!\nWould not recommend this place!", "The bar is nice, if casual and college-y. We came in for the relaxed vibes, stayed because of Jeremy. He's a gem of a bartender - didn't know him prior to wandering in, but had an extra two drinks because of his recommendations and friendly demeanor.", "We enjoyed the Classic Bloody Mary and Horchata Pina Colada. The Pork Carnitas tacos were pretty good. They were surprisingly not dry and tough, which I have encountered frequently at eateries. I will order them again. There are a lot of seating options, which is great if you want to sit away from the loud music to chat, or hang out inside near the bar speakers. Our Server Lucia was helpful and took the time to point out some menu items my wife and I can try the next time we patron the Sandbar. \n\nThe five stars are for the service(thanks Lucia), food, and atmosphere in the category of a bar&food kind of place. It is not fine dining, but it is not a dive bar either.", "Had a great late lunch on their wonderful patio.  Chile Relleno was very good.  Margarita was delicious.   Great ambience.  Service was great.  Will come back again for dinner and music.", "Came in for a bachelor party on a Wednesday July 11th and it was a blast awesome staff especially Jenny that was there to help me set up everything and give us great service as well as the others staff bartenders where awesome good at pouring drinks and super friendly. The band was awesome great music. The groom was very impressed and had a fantastic bachelor party there was his words and so did all of the other grooms men. Thank you Jenny and the sandbar staff for being a part of our week adventure here in California (from Az) it was a great!!!", "Where do I begin!! Greater \"Keanu\" was so awesome. First time in Santa Barbara and we spotted this funky cool looking bar! We were tired and thirsty, He seated us and was very informative about the menu and drinks! He made our stay feel welcome. Our Server Aliex he was so sweet very patient with my aunt because she cannot make up her mind what type of drinks. Overall great experience food is great but the employees are better take care of them!", "The food here was great and my friends enjoyed their drinks..when they came 20 minutes after ordering them! We made a reservation for 11 people on a Tuesday evening, so we thought we might be given good service for reserving a nice spot in the back a month in advance. The service we got at this restaurant was awful which sucks because the food was amazing. Our servers name was Casey, and she didn't smile a single time while serving us. As a party of 11, she hardly came around to check in on us to see if we needed anything. When it came time for the bill she wouldn't split it up for us and then disappeared for another 20 minutes for us to figure out who pays what. Eventually we got up and tracked her down to made her take down all of our orders a second time so she could make up each of our bill. We were sick of only seeing her every half hour and we were ready to leave! It almost ruined the night but once we got out we went to some better bars! Please improve the customer service because the food is delicious.", "I highly recommend this place to eat Mexican food and drink wine. The service is fantastic!", "Apparently I forgot to hit \"Post Review\" on above yelp. \n\nReturned last week and had so much fun dancing!  Dinner was great my strawberry daiquiris delicious. Always nice people, they hustle to help you. We had a new gal, very sweet AND she got all of our orders right!! Two of us are finicky orders, she handled it perfectly!  Great music, fun crowd Lora of smiles and fun!!  Thanks again!!!", "We had a great lunch here . Nachos with braised beef were yummy. My watermelon Fresca margarita was perfect. The service team of Maray and Brian was quick, accommodating and courteous . Definitely will be back.", "I wish I could give this bar 0 stars. The moment I walked in I noticed the dress code for the bar: no gold chains, no baggy pants, no jerseys, no do rags, no beanies, etc. immediately I noticed how racist this dress code was. I spoke with a male promoter who, ironically enough, was wearing a gold chain and baggy jeans, but I presume was allowed into the bar because he was white. \n\nThe fact that we are still prohibiting entry for people in DO RAGS, and other OVERTLY racist items of clothing is so disgusting and needs to be addressed immediately. \n\nWill not be supporting this bar until they remove their racist business practices.", "The food was amazing!! I got the rolled taquitos and my mom got the steak tacos. Everything was perfect and the location is unbeatable :)", "Great food! Casey took great care of our party of 5 with aplomb!!!! Will be back!!!\nVirgin blended margarita was perfect for our daughter!\nMuddled margarita was great!", "Love this spot. Energetic crowd, great music and attentive bartender. Matt took awesome care of us and was quick to refill the drinks when we got low. Didn't try the food, but everyone said I should so will next time for sure!", "Fantastic deals.   Love the happy hour: buy one get one for a quarter.\n\nEmployees all worked together to make us feel welcome, even with a party of 12 and our complicated orders. \n\nJosh benson was very very understanding when a few things didn't come out on our picky orders.  \n\nI completely recommend this place", "The service and the food was exceptional! Our waiter Ryan was over the top attentive and helpful.  He kept coming back to see if we needed anything. We were here on a \nSunday and they had a fabulous happy hour.  I had the best skinny margarita I've ever had for only $6.75 plus a buck because they added fresh strawberries.  My boyfriend ordered a Pacifico and got a second one for a quarter! The guac was delicious and the quesadilla was filled with fresh and wonderful chicken breast.  We were way too full for the soft tacos that we also ordered. Can't wait to come back to Santa Barbara, Sandbar, and Ryan!", "Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. We've been to Sandbar many times before and everything was great from food to service. Today we went again with the family and place was awful. They put so much tables ( which was shaky and my husband asked for a coaster to put under a leg) around that there is no space to walk. Table was dirty and we asked 3 times to wipe it. Our waitress was a sleepy girl whom we asked 5 times for a napkins and never got ones , salsa and chips took her forever to bring( finally other waitress brought it). Drinks was brought up 30 min later with 10 min gap in between. Finally we \"caught\" our waitress to order the food which arrived on our table 1 hr 40 min later separately from each other. We complained to a manager. I don't think we will ever come back. For this restaurant is quantity over quality. Not the same one anymore", "I cannot believe just how disappointed and dissatisfying I was with this experience. I spent $30.40 + a $5 tip HH margarita was IMPOSSIBLE to drink bc of the stupid fruit. The enchiladas have absolutely NO sauce on them. Beans look disgusting the rice was cold and old. The taco has more lettuce & cheese than it does beef. And the fact that I asked for chips and salsa with extra salsa and she tells me it comes with it; dude seriously this small little cup with 2 meals in it and you give a small cup?!? WITH an oversized side of chips?!?! I loved this place when I last went. I raved about it. Nope- not happy now!\nWere going home tomorrow. Tonight we go to to bed hangry and really disappointed. Not cool!", "Poor service. Bartender had an attitude and didn't bother to serve us until we asked him a few times. No food menu was offered until asked and nobody bothered to ask if we wanted to order anything from the menu.\n\nNot worth a trip.", "Lunch stop on the way up the coast! Dog friendly patio which is a must and great choices in seating! Quest fundido on par! Chips and salsa ok.", "Good food, good drinks, cool atmosphere. The drinks aren't very strong and the food definitely isn't authentic, but it's still delicious. It's. Great outdoor dining experience", "Been here multiple times, all not the best experience. after I leave I always tell myself I am never going to go back but I always do. After this time I will not be returning. I was eating my taquitos and all of a sudden I feel something in my mouth.. and I pull out a BLACK HAIR (my hair is blonde). I get accidents happen and they brought me new taquitos but they did not comp anything for me, still had to pay for the taquitos.. very disappointed in this restaurant, will not be returning even when I am super drunk in need of a tequila shot..", "been here multiple times, all not the best experience. after I leave I always tell myself I am never going to go back but I always do.

I want to thank general manager, site manager, waiter and all staff who took care of our family today and treat us with a great attentive service and delicious food. Thank you for considering my review from previous visit and raising restaurant service to the next level. For sure will be back again and will recommend the place.", "Last  month me and my family visited this restorant  and we got upset . We had very bad experience with one of ur waiter ( very unfriendly lady), food came late, service was not good at all. I do not think so, that we want to pay money again for this horrible costomer service", "I would like to specially thank Kimi for providing my friends and I an ultimate experience this past thursday at Sandbar! Our experience at Sandbar was exceptional thanks to Kimi's excellent accommodation! She was very kind and helpful throughout the night and made this night our best downtown experience yet! I can't wait till I come back to Sandbar, and I highly recommend asking for Kimi if you are looking to reserve tables and for events! \n\nThank you again Kimi for the amazing experience at Sandbar!", "I went to sandbar to wait for a friend and ended up spending a few very enjoyable hours with Matt. He was attentive and helpful and a good conversationalist. He was willing to put up with my friend and I being loud and excited about an upcoming trip.

Thanks Guys", "First time here and it was such a great experience!! Our server Aliex made our visit worth every penny !! He was super helpful and had such a great vibe. Highly recommend this place if you're ever in the area!!!", "Come for the happy hour!\nThis place was pretty busy on a Wednesday- and they have live music which was really fun.\nThe food was good, and the skinny margarita was delish. Plus- four girls getting apps and drinks during happy hour was only about $80!", "I always comeback to eat at the restaurant cause of the ambiance and the food tastes great! I recommend this place and it's kid friendly! You can't go wrong with that.", "Came in here for happy hour with my mom. Alex was a great server. The drink/food prices were unbeatable for the portion size during happy hour. Loved the vibe of the bar so much we went back the next day. Would definitely recommend. Alex (along with the other staff members) were polite and engaging.", "Great service, awesome \"perfect margarita\", killer shredded beef nachos and fun place to meet up with old friends and new.", "Understaffed. Make sure you have nothing to do if you're going to eat here because it will take forever. The waitress Valerie was a complete b'tch. She thought she was pretty hot stuff too, newsflash, you suck. If I was you I'd go to Rubio's instead.", "I've been to this place multiple times and have only had bad experiences. Now I'm done. I've been here for dinner and have been disappointed with the mediocre \"Mexican\" food and horrible service. I decided to give it a shot on a Thursday (college night) and took their bus (yes i paid $10 to them) Downtown only to find out I would be denied entry (with my valid California ID) because the signature on my ID wasn't raised enough (sounds like a DMV issue). The best part of all is that they let my friend who's a girl in with an expired New York ID (ha aren't they supposed to be more suspicious of out of state ID's?) To top things off every girl that I was with was let in and I was denied entry by the male bouncer and general manager at the entrance. The establishment treats their employees and guests horribly. What a joke. Wish I could give 0 stars...just walk a little further to Casa Blanca.", "I walked by on a Monday afternoon much to my surprise to see a packed patio. Sat at a fun high top all by lonesome for some good people watching. I watched the manager defuse a vocal old man \"who hated the mild salsa cause it was too hot and tell a young European girl she would get a ticket for smoking\". Yes santa Barbara is a smoke free zone, but they can't do anything about assholes. The manager kindly handled a volatile situation. The service was great. Greeted with a smile and two servers and manager, I promptly ordered a sandbar margarita which they deserved to drink too, maybe more than me. I told the manager the salsa was great, but it was definitely not hot.  I was then served a smoky hotter version, the diablo, which was tasty and should  be served regularly. I ordered the carne asada Chile relleno and it was cooked to perfection. I'd come back tomorrow if I could.", "NEVER go here. Unsympathetic staff, horrible management, just overall awful. Was trying to celebrate a friend's birthday and they ejected me for superficial reasons. Thought because I was trying to spit out their horribly mixed drinks that I was too fucked up for this place. Note that I am reviewing this place as I am \"too fucked up.\" Am I too fucked up? I don't think so. Fuck this place.", "Terrible, just plain terrible. My friends and I went to have some fun and unfortunately had an awful experience. Their alcohol was so disgusting that my friend could not swallow it so she spat it out. A worker thought she was trying to throw up, which she wasn't, and kicked us out. Did not listen to any explanations we had and just kicked us out over an assumption. How is that a way to run a business? We paid for nasty alcohol that we couldn't even swallow and got kicked out over it? If they'd at least had better customer service to combat their terrible alcohol, it would have made sense but how do you expect to stay in business when you treat your customers like trash. There are way better places in downtown Santa Barbara, I wouldn't even come back if they begged me.", "We have been coming here to watch our football games since the start of the season and have had a pretty good experience.  However, Taylor has been the best wait staff we have had by far!  Always checking up on us during the game making sure we had everything we needed, even offering recommendations.  Really had a good experience and looking forward to seeing Taylor sometime again!", "Justin made our dining experience awesome! Great service, atmosphere and cocktails. Yummy Pasilla Chili Rellenos, and fajitas, which did not include Carnitas. Not a problem, they were happy to make it for him, and the meal was amazing! Great HH bonus too! We'll be back soon!", "Just leaving Sandbar and can't express enough how great of a waiter Justin was. He was kind and attentive and provided great service. So much so, that I was compelled to write a 5 star review for him right away! Thank you, Justin, for making our time here a great experience and we will definitely be back!", "Great food! The service was FAB!\n  BUT THE FOOD!!  AWESOME-SAUCE!!\nGreat mexican food. And the salsa was great, but the chips, even better!!", "Worst place because of the management. The guy with tattoos named josh offered me and my friends bottle service for $40, so I gave him my debit card and he charged me $450. Make sure to look at your receipt when you order anything. Josh is a fraud and makes this place really bad", "This place is ridiculous. My girlfriend and I were in there on Saturday, ordered drinks, had lunch and left. Sunday, we return for breakfast, give the waitress our ID's to order drinks and she says she needs to put them under the blacklight (I have never been told this, but we said ok). They stay back there for 10 minutes and they come back to tell us they think my girlfriend's ID is fake. It is one of the new ID's and was issued by the DMV. He then says \"they are specially trained for this\" and I laughed in his face because obviously he has no clue what a real ID is. This is all ironic to me because they are notorious for getting in trouble for underage drinking. Hope this wasn't an issue because my girlfriend and I were holding hands and they wanted us out. We then went to Lama Dog where they took our ID's with no problem and said they had no clue what was wrong with the people at Sandbar. Regardless, do not go there if you want to be treated with respect! They don't know what respect is! I will NEVER come back.", "This place is an absolute horrible bar. I went years ago and the food was good for a bar watching  football on Sunday . Well I went tonight not only was the service the worst I've seen in years. 3 shots of tequila came out to $58 not including tip wow it took 15 min of standing at the bar with no acknowledgement. The bar was not even close to full. There's no excuse for service this bad. 4 bartenders maybe 20 patrons. I worked at a bar for 6 years. Literally the worst service I've ever seen. They need to clean up shop at this place ASAP. The owners must not be aware of what's going on here. Beware of this place. I'm never going back. And will tell everyone I know not to go. Truly upset about tonight.", "We stopped here for a late lunch expecting to just get something small to tide us over until dinner while exploring the area. We both ordered tostadas - he got chicken, I got beef - and we were blown away. The portions were very large and the food was so tasty. We ended up skipping dinner entirely as we were full and satisfied from this meal. Also, the price was super reasonable. I've never had a tostadas with such a great tasting salad component incorporated. I'm so sad that the Sandbar is in Santa Barbara and I am not! If we are ever back in Santa Barbara, we will definitely eat at the Sandbar again.", "Love the fire pit  and the service our server was Mariay she was amazing. We made sand bar apart of our post wedding crawl.  It was our wedding night and we got the most amazing service. Thanks for contributing to it. The margaritas are good just stick to fresh lime juice and agave...skinny anything else is going to taste like house mix sweet and sour.", "Wow what can I say.. This place is excellent. Not only did my food exceed my expectations but my server Brian was phenomenal. He described the menu in great depth and recommended the chicken sandwich. Very satisfied and will be coming back to see Brain.", "Great food!! Great pricing! Then at night it shifts into nightclub atmosphere. Brandon was super helpful in locating my credit card when I had lost it. He was prob also very patient with us knowing how are group gets. Place is tight", "Went on 12/13/18 with a group of friends and ordered \"the nachos\". Once we got the nachos mid way through we found about 3 pieces of paper which looked like straw covers. Manager has no empathy to this situation. Absolutely unnecessary and disgusting. How does the paper from the straws get into our food? I will most likely never go back to this restaurant and highly don't recommend.", "This is a really cool place. Santa Barbara has a bunch of nice places to eat and I can definitely recommend that this place is one of them. Our server was super cool, very easy to talk to and took care of everything we ordered. It also was pretty chill so our food came by pretty quick.", "Hands down the best steak fajitas this native Angelena has ever had. Fun vibe, cozy, and delicious salsa. Would love to come back for happy hour next time I'm in Santa Barbara!", "Happy hour menu and prices are great!  Service is awesome.  Allows small dogs.  Food portions are pretty big.  Left stuffed and happy.", "We went to this restaurant on Christmas day , almost every where was closed . We had just few options for the lunch , we got our table in 10 minutes.  service was really good and fast."], "meta": ["We randomly popped into the Sandbar after spending the morning shopping in Santa Barbara and we were completely blown away!  Let's start with the staff - each person with whom we had contact was happy to be there, engaging, and friendly.  What a great start to the experience.  We both ordered tacos and couldn't have been happier.  I ordered the grilled veggie tacos - they had some spice but were cooled by the queso fresco.  Hubby ordered the chicken tacos and though more spicy than the veggie ones, weren't so spicy that they couldn't be inhaled!  Both sets of tacos were elevated to the next level by the homemade tortillas.  Simply delicious and authentic.", "This place has really turned itself around over the years. I just noticed my bad review from 2009 and felt I should update now that the place is run completely differently. The food is now excellent and the staff courteous.", "Was pretty disappointed. Went on the opening night of there remodel, had a good time. Then went back the next night with a group of friends. They would not except my out of state ID can you believe that!! In Santa Barbara a \"tourist town\". I Had been going there for years and never had an issue with my AZ ID. I gave them my credit card, my California sales license and a work license and still was not good enough. I am 25yrs old.. They rejected my ID the lady asked me for a passport. Now What would I, an American in America be caring around my passport for??  will not be bringing my business there. See Ya sandbar.", "Best Mexican grill and bar in Santa Barbara. Our server Lillian was the very best, Will definitely come again. Already planning breakfast tomorrow morning!", "This has to be the worse service. Got seated right away and then sat and waited. No one even acknowledged we were here for a good 15 min. Then another couple was seated near us. They got asked for drinks and food order before we were even acknowledged. Finally our waiter came, took our order and left. We got chips and finished them. Waiter asked if we wanted more, we said yes. Everyone around us got more chips, and we still wait for our food. The couple seated after us got their food and we finally get more chips, but no food. \n\nWorse service, will not eat here again.", "Margaritas! Margaritas! Margaritas!\n\nGreat Bar! Great service! Good vibes!\n\nCame to this bar twice over the weekend, our drinks Margarita and Mojito were made just right! ( If not mistaken, Scott (?) bartender was very friendly, helpful and skilled  young guy).\nVery nice touch from Sandbar - free freshly baked chips and salsa offered for the table as soon as you seated.\n\nThey play variable music and you can definitely catch up on some sport games on big screens all around you.\n\nWill be back!", "A group of 9 of us went to Sandbar on a Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday. The person taking the reservation was friendly and helpful. We couldn't get a table on the patio, but the table we were seated was open to the outside so we did not feel closed in. Our server was outstanding. He was very attentive and interacted well with everyone in the group. I had the La Asada con Salsa and it was outstanding. The meat was tender and the marinade was very flavorful. My wife said her tacos were the best she had in a long time as the ground meat tasted like good steak. Everyone had something different and said their food was excellent. All our food was served at the same time (not easy with a large group) and at a proper temperature. They brought up some flan to celebrate the birthday and it was the best flan I have eaten. Sandbar is a busy place (especially on a weekend evening) but they have a large staff that really hustle and appear to work well as a team. We will be back when we come back to Santa Barbara.", "Food was amazing. I really don't see to much of a difference in the new renovations but it does look cleaner. I'd  recommend this place to anyone.especialy on happy hour.", "We just went to get a table outside with our pup and the hostess told us we could tie our dog up to the fence on the outside.

It is my second time at this restaurant. I will definitely come back ))))", "I have returned to Sandbar several more times for both dinner and breakfast since my last brief review and I have to say, this place now pops up at the top of my list when I'm craving Mexican food downtown and a bustling atmosphere. I've had their chicken soft taco plate, the three mini taco plate, one of their burritos, their chicken fajitas, and one of their breakfast hash dishes. All were excellent and get extra points for visually pleasing classy presentation. Top quality breast chicken or gristle free steak is huge for me and they prepare it wonderfully. This isn't bar food, this is a nice Mexican restaurant with a bar.", "Wow. Love the new look. Always seated fast and by far the best chips and salsa in town. Today was so busy being it Saturday afternoon the resturant was packed but we felt totaly taken care of by our waitress Shannon. GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!", "Great happy hour!! Margaritas are on point and the food is delicious and fresh. Check out the tostada salad.", "Had the boat in SB for several weeks so we had the opportunity to try Sandbar's new Breakfast/Brunch two weekends in a row.  First one, on 4/5 sold us on the new cool deal, $7.50 for a great breakfast, Kings Hawaiian bread french toast with eggs, bacon and potatoes, also included a Bloody Mary, Screwdriver or a Grayhound!  Awesome deal, and the food was awesome as well, Lillian was our server, she was great, very friendly and helpful.  We came back again next weekend on 4/11 and got the same great deal, food was fantastic once again, got the Grayhounds this time and our server was Jessilynn, she was really cool, efficient, friendly and very helpful.  This place rocks, it's beautiful, outdoor seating with really nice tables and booths with firepits.  Go and enjoy great drinks, excellent food and service.", "Went to this restaurant on a whim, and it was the best stop! The guy at the front was very friendly and cute. The food was very good! Their portions are huge and the prices are super reasonable for being on state street.", "this place was packed with a great ambience. my bartender austin was amazing very friendly and upbeat. we happen to talk to a girl that was very smiley and friendly.  she was very interactive with all the guests and her staff oh snap she happens to be one of the managers on duty. she asked us where we from and asked me what i did for work. she actually cared about what i was saying. lol so long story short. i definitely will be back even if i have to drive an hour to get there. well  worth it thank you lillian and austin for making my sunday funday sooooo much better . xoxo", "Red is awesome!  This girl rocks. I wish every bar had a red. Her drinks are the best. Dirty martinis are not my \"jam\" but reds dirty martinis are bomb! She is a Rockstar", "Always come here for Mexican food when I come to town and I'm always impressed by food, staff and the atmosphere. Food is delicious and always on point. Happy hour always a deal buy a beer and get one for quarter:) Great location and facilities. Staff is always helpful, nice and respectful. It's a great bar/restaurant in SB.", "After many visits to the Sandbar the last visit might be the last. Last week my husband and I went with our two friends. They have a two year old and so do we. Has we drove by the restaurant we noticed there was a couple with a stroller eating at the restaurant. One of our kids was asleep so we decided to take the stroller with the sleeping child in it. \n\n     Once we got to the front the hostess informed us that we would have to fold the stroller and put it in a designated stroller area because we couldn't take it in the restaurant (we agreed to it) we completely understand.  What we didn't understand is why there was somebody else already sitting there with a stroller open. We didn't question it. Clair (the hostess) asked how many people were in our party. It was a total of four adults and two children. Clair asked us if we wanted to sit in the high chairs or low ones. We requested the low ones. She gave us a look and asked someone else if that would be possible. What came out of her mouth next is ridiculous! Clair said \"But the kids have to sit on a chair they can't be held because it's a hazard\".  Clair you clearly have much to learn in the world of customer service  and better yet in life!\n\n     I contact the restaurant to file a formal complain. I spoke to one of the supervisors who apologized and said Clair was one of the newer employees. The supervisor took my name and number and assure me that the manager would contact me no later than the next day. Well it has now been three days later and I'm still waiting. \n\n     To an extent my party and I felt like Clair didn't want us to eat at the restaurant. I'm not sure what it is she was basing her hostility at? Was it the fact we had children with us (at 3 in the afternoon) or was it the way we looked? It's unfortunate that they have an employee of that sort has the first line of contact with the clients. With that said with so many options of restaurants on state street the Sandbar will definitely not be on our list.", "This place is the BOMB!!!! food is Mexican Cuisine at its finest! We went on 5/13/2015 with my wife. The service was great from start to finish! Our waitress Aby was the best waitress ever! she greeted us with a smile even though the Restaurant was very busy. Thank you Aby!", "We had dinner at Sandbar while we were in town for my sister's bachelorette party. We loved it! Cool atmosphere and delicious margaritas. I wish we had stayed there all night, because we left and went to EOS (we had a package there) and sandbar was clearly the better choice! Very fun!", "My friend and I went to Sandbar yesterday to grab drinks and check out the new remodel. The pictures looked awesome, so we wanted to see it for ourselves. We were happy to see it wasn't very busy and were seated at a table outside but near the bar. We were promptly delivered chips and salsa and ate that while waiting for our server to come take our drink order. 10 minutes after being seated, I heard a gentleman say into his ear piece/communication thing that \"table 12 has been sitting there for awhile with only chips and salsa, no drinks.\" We thought we would be helped after that but no such luck. We sat there for another 30 minutes waiting to put in our order. No one ever came to our table or even looked our direction and we watched while tables who were seated after us received their drinks and food before us. Finally after waiting close to 40 minutes we finally gave up and left. As we were leaving, the host asked us if we enjoyed our drinks. We informed him that we never saw our server to order our drinks. There was no apology or anything, he simply said \"oh, I think the bar was in charge of that section, they should have helped you.\" Perhaps he was new, he was very nice, but he definitely did not appear to know how to handle the situation and did not attempt to remedy it in any way. Due to the negligent and inattentive service, I will most likely not be returning to Sandbar.", "Great outdoor dining with an interesting horchata/pi\u00f1a colada drink that must be tasted!\n\nThe food is home style Mexican and was truly amazing: seafood enchiladas, chicken burrito, and soft tacos all disappeared quickly.\n\nBest of all - truly excellent service!\n(I was 5 tables away, but the hostess noticed I needed a new knife and brought me one before I could ask!", "My co-worker and I were looking for something that caught our attention for dinner, Sandbar did just that, excellent drinks, authentic and delicious mexican food, and the outdoor environment made me feel comfortable and like I was in Mexico downtown cantina, Great place,  so good I went back the next day! Lillian was our server and was most helpful with suggestions, service and local things to see, this was my favorite dinner in Santa Barbara after spending 7 days here :) Shari from Seattle", "This place will receive no stars from me... We were walking up state street with our daughters on Saturday before Father's Day and stumbled across this place... They were able to seat is quickly so we decided to try it... The food was ok, but the manager is a JERK!!!! My 5yr old is autistic and has certain quirks, one being shredding paper to keep her calm and dinner peaceful... We had almost finished our dinner and everything was going great until the manager walked us to us and told us not to let her drop paper on the floor because he doesn't want his guys to have to keep cleaning it up.... It's a restaurant duche bag stuff is gonna fall on the floor!!!!  Our family goes out to restaurants on a very regular basis and have never had anyone say anything to us about her paper, we always clean up her mess on our own before we leave and usually they tell us not to worry about it... This A-hole basically ruined the experience and humiliated us in the process... The place is crowded and close quarters so others heard him and we pretty much packed up and left immediately... Is he going to tell a parent with a toddler to make sure they don't drop their food on the floor????? This was very upsetting!!! Not a good place to go if you or your family member have special needs and if you want to Support the cause don't go to this place - the manager discriminates!!!", "I came here during the afternoon and the environment is chill but fun. Got some really good carne asada tacos and a Moscow mule. My waitress lil h was the shit and very friendly.", "The food is great, but the service is phenomenal. Art made sure my family was taken care of, and even made recommendations and suggestions when were were stunned by the variety. He was personable, friendly, and very helpful.", "Good food. Nice patio. Abbey was a wonderful server. She made the experience fun.  \n\nWe were walking down State Street looking for a good place to eat and their outdoor seating and friendly hostess caught our attention.  Glad it did.\n\nThe food was more upscale mexican food, but not so fancy that it forgot what it was.  We had the tostadas and the burrito del playa.  Both were great!", "Oh my god!!! These are the best carne asada tacos we have ever had!  They are even better than the ones i make!  If your ever in Santa Barbara on State Street stop on and eat about 10 of them!!!! So totally incredible!", "This place touches every end of the spectrum. If you want to sit in doors, they have it, if you want to people watch on the best, and busiest patio in santa Barbara, they have it... wanna lounge by a fire pit, they have it. Want a old margarita? they have it... want good food, happy hour, brunch?? They have it... Wanna dance and have a good time at night? They have that too. Food is good, portions are generous, prices are great, and life is good by the fire pit.", "Been here a few times the last 7 or 8 years and it's a nice place. The food is fantastic and the staff and atmosphere is great. Came here on a date and just to hang out and it was cool either way. The guacamole is fantastic and the rest of the food is pretty good, too. Overall, I really enjoy coming here", "This is my first review on Yelp. I feel like I have a responsibility to warn people to stay away from this dump. \n\nWhere to begin? Let's start with the hair. That's right, my sister's margarita glass wasn't just rimmed with salt -- she also found a hair! The bright side: the hair in your margarita will give you something to talk about as you wait...and wait...and wait...for them to bring out your food. \n\nYou can also fill up on their flat Coke with no fizz. \n\nWhen they finally do bring out your food (after what feels like 6 hours) you'll have to eat with one hand. Because you'll need the other hand to swat the flies infesting the outdoor patio (it's an admittedly nice patio, and what tricked us into entering this hell hole). But the flies are a distraction from the bland food (we had tostadas, fish tacos and burgers) that will later send you racing to the bathroom in a diarrhetic attack. \n\nJust don't expect to use the bathroom at this restaurant. I was headed for the men's room but the stench right outside the door was so strong that I did an about-face, asked our snotty waitress for the check (her attitude was what you'd expect from a waitress at a three-star Michelin restaurant) and got the hell out of there. \n\nThe whole experience was comical. At least we got a laugh out of it. We laughed at the hair, at the flies, at the poor service, at the crappy food, at the smelly bathroom. But the next morning my upset stomach was churning and I wasn't laughing anymore. I was pissed off. And I came here to write this review. \n\nThe Sandbar: enter at your own risk! You've been warned.", "Looking for great food, awesome drinks, friendly staff, a nightclub that will have you on the dance floor all night long? Then SANDBAR is the spot to be at ! Always a great time !", "Delicious food, vibrant atmosphere and great service!  Sandbar is a must do!  Nachos with beef was amazing!  Guacamole was creamy and flavorful!  Visiting from Charlotte, NC and couldn't have stumbled upon a better place for lunch!  Thanks to Yelp!", "I always wondered why there was a line outside of Sandbar. \n\nToday I found out. When I went there there were about 20% of tables with no one at them.  But everyone that went to the hostess was told there was a 10 to 15 minute wait. I asked why. I was told the kitchen was recovering from a large group. So it was better for us to wait on State St. Instead of a table.\n\nWe waited anyway. Food average. Plenty of other places in town with a better system and better food. \n\nThey make people wait on State St so it looks popular.  Don't fall for there ploy. \nI'm never going back!", "Jason at Sandbar is amazing. He made me and my friend the most amazing drinks & was very fun! Thank you thank you so much for taking care of us and making us have a good time!", "My boyfriend and I were dining here a couple months back, and we saw 2 guys with their girlfriends trying to get a table. These guys were very obviously Mexican. The hostess didn't let them in because she said their shorts were \"too baggy,\" or something stupid like that. No kidding, about 10 minutes later, a white family walks in and the man in that group was wearing shorts that were just as \"baggy\" as the other guys we wearing. But they let him in, no problem. For a \"Mexican\" restaurant, they really aren't very Mexican friendly. And being Mexican myself, I can honestly say I will never dine there again.", "Last weekend I visited this restaurant several times and each time it was wonderful.  The food and service was great and I want to thank Arthur and Nicolette and the rest of the staff for a great time.  I will be back to revisit soon.", "The food was amazing and let's not talk about the margaritas! The service was good and a nice little spot to hang out near the beach....", "Sorry ass DJ , salty ass food , salty ass security guards... Don't waste time and money here", "Visited them during happy hour Friday. It was really happy hour. great service, great food and  great drink. Try their nacho with chicken!", "I've had absolutely terrible service on multiple visits. Clearly this isn't something they care to improve and I will not be back.\nDon't waste your time or money.", "I took my wife shopping in Santa Barbara and stopped by during happy hour for a beer. I'm not a cheap person but $6.75 for a 8 ounce glass of 805 beer is not considered happy hour.. The facilities are nothing to write home about so the place should be added to the list of current tourist  traps. I'm a good tipper  but I  hate getting ripped off. Fortunately there are many other great places nearby. \nNEVER AGAIN !!!!", "Ate here yesterday and loved it! Our server was awesome, very knowledgable and on top of it. Skinny strawberry margarita is delicious and refreshing. Best food item we had: the steak fajitas! Would definitely recommend and will be back. Enjoyed the indoor/outdoor seating. Thanks!", "Great service, great food, great drinks. My margarita was pretty strong, which I can appreciate at a restaurant (normally they aren't worth the money). I got a taco and enchilada combo plate which was plenty of food and quite tasty. I think this restaurants strong point is the atmosphere - open, outdoor seating with beautiful lighting and nice music. Not so dark that you can't see, but creates a cool vibe. The staff was very capable and friendly, from start to finish. Definitely where I take all my out of town guests!", "I'd like to repost this review because I find it to still be relevant... Aron the manager is still giving the same b.s. Responses to people who are continuing to be discriminated against... I'm sorry, isn't there something I the Constitution about this sort of blatant discrimination??? \n\nIs it possible to give a ZERO STARS rating? \n\nMy husband and I have visited the Sandbar every time we have come to Santa Barbara for the last few years. The food is mediocre at best, the service was always less than amazing but we always enjoyed the atmosphere and so, always returned - it was always our first stop for a drink when we would come into town. This past trip, when my husband approached the hostess stand, the hostess informed him she could not seat the party (of 10 people no less) because of HIS visible neck tattoo - a tattoo that is a picture of me, his wife, and my name, Candace... This is bizarre for a number of reasons - 1. We have been to the Sandbar A MINIMUM of 5 times with no incident or mention of his \"problematic\" tattoo. 2. Nowhere on the Sandbar website or Facebook Page can I find any - and I'm quoting Aron, the manager VERBATIM - mention of this \"Corporate Policy\". 3. Other patrons had visible tattoos on their arms, legs, backs, etc and yet a man with his wife's name on his neck was turned away - AFTER being a loyal patron for several years! Hmmm THAT'S ODD. This, in my opinion, is a BLATANT discrimination. Perhaps when you visit, they'll find something about YOU that they deem \"unacceptable\" - maybe you dye your hair, OR you wear colored contacts, OR have a religious affiliation they don't have room for... Whatever it is - whether you have tattoos or not (I have none by the way) - I would NEVER RECOMMEND GIVING YOUR HARD EARNED $$$ TO AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT SO BLATANTLY DISCRIMINATES AND DISRESPECTS FORMER, LOYAL PATRONS . It's despicable. And there are MANY, MANY other great bars withBETTER FOOD and BETTER SERVICE on State Street and in Santa Barbara. Please don't patronize businesses who have no problem reverting back to an era of having to fight for civil rights and liberties.", "So disappointed. I bought 1 vodka redbull and a cider and it was $18!!! There are places that will give you a much better deal. They actual charged me for the well drink and a $3 additional to add the red bull. Bullshit. It had nice music and it looks pretty clean. Go to another bar to save you money.   Yuppies... You are the people they are looking for here\n\n\nAlso, take the time to read the other reviews. The rep from the restaurant is full of it. It's almost like his replies are a joke. Clearly he isn't actually doing anything to fix these problems. Don't waste your time here. I don't want my money going to a dishonest business that doesn't take customer service seriously.", "I usually don't like to leave bad reviews, but I don't want anyone else to waste their bachelorette party & money like I did. I REPEAT! BACHELORETTES BEWARE!\n\nI recently had my bachelorette party at Sandbar. I came up from San Diego, and had friends fly in from all over the country, from New York and Florida, for the weekend.  I wish we would have had dinner and left. The food & our waitress were phenomenal, and the atmosphere is pretty cool, but I wish we didn't waste so much time there. \n\nMy night started off on a bad note before we even got there, because promoter contacted me offering me a free bottle of champagne in their \"VIP\" booth after our dinner... Yes, its true. They offered me the exact same \"Bottle Service\" package that I had ALREADY paid for, for free.  I can't believe they didn't comp it. I should have known to just leave after dinner, and only waste my money.. not my time too. \n\nI paid $100 for the lowest tier of \"bottle service\" which is false advertisement, due to the lack of actual service. After getting seated for \"bottle service\" at 10:30, we didn't actually get any booze at our table until after 11:00, only because I went & asked where it was.  I have no clue what our server was paying attention to, but it wasn't us. The \"bottle service\" should have come with one bottle of Chandon & a round of Jell-O Shots. The week prior, I asked the coordinator if we could swap the round of jello shots with a round of champagne, since jello shots aren't really my style, and she agreed, with the understanding that the \"round\" of champagne would be of a \"lower quality\" than the Chandon. Thats fine with me, I'm not picky about my bubbles. I also requested a cute non-alcholoic drink for my pregnant sister so she didn't feel left out. We ended up recieving one bottle of champagne, no extra round of champagne, and no jello shots (and no cute drink for my sister). Out of irony, my friend bought jello shots to \"lighten\" the mood since things were going so down hill. I had planned this party for months, and it was crashing and burning. \n\nI was told there would be \"decorations\" at our table, The decorations consisted of 3 deflated balloons, 4 rubber bracelets (for 8 of us) and half a feather boa. Im not even kidding, the boa was cut in half, you could tell because it was really short, and the cut end was shedding feathers like crazy. I was also told that our table would be in a \"private\" area, but they were seating people up in the raised area with us to eat dinner. Come one! Come All! \n\nOnce I alerted an employee that we didn't even have booze at our table, he brought us two bottles \"on the house\" that were on the menu for $18 each. I think they were non alcoholic. Both were immediately opened by an employee which was lame because we weren't going to put down two bottles ASAP, so the second bottle was just open, losing its bubble. Sad. \n\nOur \"real\" server must have been alerted that we didn't receive our \"real\" bottle and brought the Chandon shortly after. She also went to open the bottle, but I stopped her and pointed at the 2 open bottles already sitting on the table. She had already taken the cage off, and she ACTUALLY handed me the cage, and set the bottle in the ice bucket pointed right at the face of my pregnant sister. Seriously. Loaded champagne bottle, no cage, to the face. I can't believe she didn't bring us a new bottle, and I really can't believe she tipped it at someones face with no cage. \n\nSince we were thankfully sober from drinking only $18 bottle champagne, we realized her mistake immediatly and pointed it upwards.. I tried my best to re-attach the cage by twisting it on, but it unsurprisingly popped off within 10 minutes, which was the most exciting thing that happened all night. I gave this review one star because nobody lost an eye.\n\nBy then we were all suffering from serious buzzkill and decided to go dance on the smallest dance floor in the world. Advertising as a \"night club\" is misleading. My friend requested the artist \"Future\" and the DJ actually told her \"we don't play ghetto music\" which is appalling and to be honest, quite racist. \n\nI could tell my friends wanted to leave because it was just awkward, and we couldn't shake the buzzkill. We asked around and decided to leave to a place called Wild Cat that sounded pretty fun. The place was kind of seedy, but a much needed dose of humor after wasting almost the whole night at Sandbar. I wish I was able to leave a better review, but our few hours at Sandbar was the black mark on our trip. I might go back for dinner, but do not recommend that anyone way pay extra for their rip-off \"service\".", "Very good food, huge portions.  The service was great.", "WHAT A GREAT PLACE~~~~!!! The food is consistently good.. very high quality.. particularly because you can make a case that this is a tourist trap location... on State ST.. and all.. but we have been going here since it opened several years ago and have yet to not be completely happy!!!! GREAT PLACE, NICE EMPLOYEES, GREAT FOOD, GREAT DRINK.. GREAT ATMOSPHERE.... I HIGHLY recommend it.", "This place is horrible. Service is just the worst. If your in SB go somewhere else. Had a group of 6 people that asked us to move from our table and then had no table for us. We came for dinner and drinks and the staff was rude and honestly with so many choices in Santa Barbara, why go to a place that has zero customer service.", "I am visiting from out of town and was excited to stop by this bar after dinner. However, the bouncer looked at my ID and told me that the only way I would get it back was from a police officer and that using a fake ID was a felony charge. I am 25 years old. Ive never had anything like this happen and am completely appalled by their rudeness and complete lack of respect.", "Took my wife to Sandbar like I always do every other week. and the food as always a perfect 10! had the Asada Salsa plate 2 words pure perfection! SHANNON YOU ARE THE BEST!!!! my wife and I have been coming to Sandbar for many years for dinner but last night our waitress Shannon ROCKED! She has been our waitress on 4 occasions. She was very attentive, pleasant even though some customers weren't very nice she never stopped smiling. Thank you Sandbar Thank you Shannon and good luck ;)", "This place is fantastic! The vibe is very inviting and gets you energized! Came here for my 21st birthday, compliments of Mr. Brandon Alt who made the whole night go soo smoothly. Everything from drinks to a bandaid that I desperately needed! My crew and I felt sincerely taken care of. Definitely will be a repeat customer!", "Made a random stop here during a trip to Santa Barbara in November. Amazing food, great service, and awesome decor", "I ate there tuesday for lunch i ordered an enchilada plate. Within 5 minutes i had my meal. You might say good service, however, i have worked in hospitality for a few years and i know my meal was not fresh, and it was not brought up to the right temp. However, i gave it a shot knowing better. Turned out i was right, i have been sick for 3 days. That was the last thing i was able to eat, so thanks sandbar. Hopefully you will start cooking properly", "We are from out-of-town and were looking for something fun to do on a Wednesday night. One of the local tasting rooms recommended Sandbar for their reggae night. We had already eaten, so this review is only based on the cocktails and atmosphere. The band was fun and the half indoor/half outdoor ambiance was really cool. The staff was all super friendly and helped make my roommate's birthday great, especially Jamie! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!", "Flies!!! Read \"not recommended reviews\". I wish I had. \n\nYay I love flies drinking my water and on my food. Really bad service and food had no flavor. Could not not not get any salsa. No flavor in the food just really a waste of time and money. Margarita was weak. Beef burrito was gummy. No spices.  Beer was good. If this place did not have outdoor seating would not have gone. Is that all it takes to stay in business here?  I would also say that boyfriend had chicken tacos with \"homemade tortillas\".  He was not impressed.  I make better chile sauce with dried ancho and pasilla chilies from the local store.  Oh well.", "Came while my husband and I were visiting Santa Barbara and this place was amazing!! Food was great and happy hour was definitely well worth it!", "I typically end up here on the weekends, it's always a good time! I love sitting around the firepit drinking margaritas with friends! They also have an awesome breakfast deal!", "Usually we head to casa blanca for Sunday brunch, but last week we gave sandbar a try. It's a crazy good deal with food and a drink for under $10. My mimosa was good, but my friend's bloody mary was awesome! Definitely going back!", "Hit sandbar to celebrate a friend's newly single status. Perfect margaritas and tequila shots got us in a good place. Only bummer was we went out after the kitchen closed. Had to get our drunk food elsewhere. But good drinks and good music topped off with hot ladies galore!", "This place has awesome patio seating! It's a great place to grab a drink and watch people on State St! The ceviche is great and I think they make their own salsa. Their drinks have definitely gotten way better over the last couple years, and I recommend the margaritas!", "Dustin was a great server ! Continuously checked up on us and refilled our drinks! Sandbar has excellent service! Highly recommend Sandbar!", "Great find, excellent service... and the chips and salsa...  totally worth the drive from anywhere.", "Don't go here. We were seated for like 10 minutes and no one even came by our table. We went up to the hostess and asked if we were going to get any service, and 5 minutes later still no one came by. We got up and left. Don't support a restaurant that has such horrible customer service.", "Bad attitudes all around. Don't recommend at all. Stay away. Why would you need to provide a driver's license and your credit card to sit down to have food? I don't trust anyone to have my info unattended (home billing info and my cc #). Bad policy by owner which bartender told me - \"not my rules\". Took my drink order then went to text after pouring my drink... I watched my drink sit there' tic toc, tic toc until he was finished with his personal business. Goodnight. I opted to pay cash and left. I just should have left...", "Good food. Great atmosphere. Really nice staff. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town!", "Arthur the manager and his team handled our large party with ease! Fifty or so people and we were graciously accommodated and the food was tasty! I had the fajitas and they are very good. The atmosphere is perfect for a celebration. Lots of great seating areas, and plenty of televisions in the bar and back area. The servers were excellent as well. It's the type of restaurant where you don't necessarily need your specific server to get assistance. Anyone is happy to help. Another bonus is that we were given our check by table. So I was at a table with 3 others and we only had to be concerned with our own bill. Lastly, we spent lots of time taking photos and more than once we were in the way of servers coming to and from the kitchen. They would wait for us to get the picture before walking past. So nice!", "The food was really good I got the fried shrimp tacos and that sauce was to die for. I also tried the carne asada tacos but they weren't as good. The waiters were so nice and it really is a great place to eat.", "The food here is fire. Situated between two buildings on lower State St., Sandbar is a restaurant/cantina which morphs into a club at night. Great for dinner, drinks, and birthdays! The space isn't large but there's lots of seating, some cool fire pits, and great atmosphere. If you want some value in terms of drinks, grab a \"Blackout Beach\" and split that thing with 2-3 people. The bar can be a bit crammed, but that's part of the charm.", "Came in tonight for late night drinks and the bar was super busy and Brandon the bartender went out of his way to make sure me and my group of friends were taken care of! Excellent service and awesome lounge atmosphere in Santa Barbara... I will recommend it to all my friends. We were\nStarving and they got our last minute food order in of nachos which were amazing... Must try!!!", "I usually do not go to bars, but we decided to give this one a try! Our waitress Lillian gave her recommendations and gave us great service! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, talkative, and attentive. Had a nice small dinner with no complains.", "RICH is the bomb. He is the most personable bartender who has ever served us. He was tentative and made sure our drink were always full. He is a bartender that makes you feel like you have known him for years", "Sandbar is amazing. Was in Santa Barbara for a Sales Meeting and it's the only place our Sale Staff wanted to go on a very competitive State Street. The drinks were good, music was great (coming from a DJ/Music snob), service was great, Management (Art) was the best part. Great place to check out for a good time in Santa Barbara. You'll love it.", "Great food, nice selection of margaritas - all made with fresh squeezed lime juice - with a cool, casual vibe. Lillian is an awesome server - fast and friendly with a great sense of humor. \n\nThis is my favorite State Street restaurant. If you're feeling Mexican, this is the place to be.", "I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Normally, I avoid Mexican restaurants because let's face it, if I want good Mexican food, I'll stay home and cook. However, when I walked by, the hacienda style structure caught my eyes and the food that was served on the patio looked delish.  I decided to take a chance and check it out.  Dang....I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the Sandbar Margarita.  It was perfectly made.  Not weak at all.  The chips and salsa are sooo flavorful.  The salsa had a medium heat and full of tasty spices. Two for two so far. I decided to order the cilantro lime carne tacos.  Oh man!!  The homemade tortilla was thick and delicious.  The meat was seasoned to perfectios and was tender and juicy.  The cabbage and jalepe\u00f1o mix was a perfect topping. The service was extremely friendly.  I will definitely return and next time I might also check out the evening DJ/Dancing.", "Love this place. My group of 8 came for happy hour. Chelsea our waitress was awesome.  She was very friendly and patient with our group.  The food was awesome and so were the drinks. Every one was more than happy with our service and food. Definitely coming back.", "Great atmosphere but disgusting dirty wine glasses. We sent back a drink in a dirty glass and it was re-served in a wiped out dirty glass. If something that simple is very wrong how is the food?", "Slow, unprofessional, and not qualified to check IDs. Never been treated so poorly.  Would not recommend.", "The happy hour here is really great! Buy one drink and get the second for 25 cents. My bartender Jeremy took really great care of me and told me about reggae nights on Wednesdays. I came back Wednesday night and the band was really fun.", "Best restaurant and bar on State Street.  Excellent service, thank you Lillian, food, and ambiance.  First time visited for dinner.  The new remodel makes for a cozier and warmer feeling.  \nOur server was absolutely the best.  Lillian knew the menu backwards and forwards, was extremely attentive, and we loved the entire experience!!\n\nDefinitely will recommend to friends and family, and come back soon myself!!!", "Food poisoning!!! Had happy hour chips, quac, salsa and a beer. We instantly recognized that the salsa tasted weird. I said hmm... I can't pinpoint what it is - maybe it's seasoning/style. Hubby said no way, I'm not eating that. I stopped too, we mainly wanted the quac anyways. Well as soon as we get back to the hotel all horrendous and unpleasant things related to food poisoning happened to me!!! Hubby has a stomach made of steal, I guess, because we ate all the same things!! I might have had a few more bites of salsa than he did. Definitely gross!!! They used tons of gross seasonings to hide the fact that they are either using old and leftover salsa or they are using old rotten unwashed tomatoes. Maybe it's been sitting out, who knows!!!\nShould have told the waiter that the salsa tasted funny at the restaurant..now I've learned my lesson the most unpleasant and hard way!", "If I could give this place less than a star, I would. From the time my friend and I arrived until the second we left, our experience was ridiculously awful. The person whom initially seated was seemed annoyed and dismissive. We glanced at the menu and asked each other if we wanted to still eat here, and we settled. My friend ordered the slow braised beef sandwich, and I ordered the Mahi sandwich. We took a bite of our sandwiches and were both not pleased. Her sandwich was very messy, and we couldn't for the life of us get our server's attention to get any napkins or a refill of water. Her beef sandwich had absolutely no flavor but the salt that was dumped onto the beef. My mahi sandwich was very similar, no flavor at all. There was also almost no fish in this sandwich, just a bunch of flavorless fillings and a bun. Our server hardly ever came to check on us, and when we decided to try to salvage the super disappointing meal with dessert, the person who came and took our full plates away asked, \"So, how was everything?\" We told him \"Eh, not very good\", and all he said was \"I'm sorry\" and walked away. What was the use of asking? Was there anything you could've done to salvage our meal/experience at all? The dessert was fine, but didn't make up for anything. When our server came and gave us the bill, she didn't even bother to ask how everything was. We figured it probably wouldn't matter anyway, since they'd just apologize, dismiss you, and not try to assist you at all. My friend and I walked away very upset, unsatisfied, and once we got home, feeling rather sick, from the very little we ate. Most disappointing $20 I've spent. I don't recommend this place to anyone who enjoys to go out to eat a decent meal and have at least sub-par service.", "Fun ambiance with great music, comfortable seating, great food and great service.  Our server, Lillian was awesome!  The prices match the quality of the food.  Despite being a more Adult place, they were very kid friendly!", "Sandbar was a complete surprise. A friend took me there and I expected the typical bar food Mexican restaurant, with bad drinks, bad food and bad service! HOWEVER, Sandbar was just the opposite!!! When we arrived around 6 the place was busy but we still got a perfect outdoor table. As soon as we were settled our server, Lilian took our drink order and in minutes were sipping a delicious Margarita and munching on warm tortilla chip and a spicy guacamole. Lillian was incredibly attentive and answered our questions about the menu. I was particular, as I've had so many bad Mexican meals that sound good but have no flavor. I settled on the faitas and my friend got a burrito platter. The food came quickly and my fajitas, with peppers, onions juicy chicken came on a sizzling platter with plenty of tortillas. Again Lillian was right there to make sure everything was good. Have you ever kept eating because it tasted so good even though you were full? That was me...stuffed and still eating. We had another Margarita and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Great vibe, great service, and great food. Perfect!!", "Stopped in for happy hour!!! Best service!!! Best margaritas !!!! Best salsa....didn't ever have to ask for more... He just kept it coming...!!! Cra how good this place is!!!", "Had a great time tonight at sandbar, waitress was great and very friendly (brunette with red flower in hair). Our appetizer was the hand rolled taquitos which were awesome! I had the taco, enchiladas combo platter everything was tasty, girlfriend had a burrito which was great too. Pretty fun atmosphere, everyone in a good mood, I recommend.", "Great place for Happy Hour!  Service was awesome on a busy Thursday night!  Try it out.", "My wife and I spent 5 days in Santa Barbara for a friends wedding. We ate out nearly every meal and Sandbar was one of our favorites. The Sunday brunch special was a great deal. Around $8 for a large portion of delicious French toast and sides. It also included a very tasty mango mimosa. We also ordered the fajitas. In my opinion some of the best I've ever had! To top it all off, we had excellent service provided by our waitress Lillian! She was more than hospitable and made our experience outstanding. We will definitely be back on our next visit!", "Used to be one of my favorite lunch spots until the hostess rudely asked my friend and I to leave AFTER she had already seated us (we are both 20) on St. Patrick's Day around 3 pm. We felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome, as the hostess awkwardly stared us down until we left and handled the situation in such an unprofessional manner. After asking if the other restaurants on State had this same policy, she simply shrugged and told us I don't know and to walk \"that way\" and find something else as she then proceeded to stand and watch silently as we tried to leave with some dignity.  Had she have explained in a kind manner that St. Patrick's Day was the exception to their allowing under 21s to dine, we would not have been so upset. We will never go back again.", "So came to SB to visit for the weekend and ended up at this place 3 times in 2 days. Fun place to go out with friends and the food was good too! The manager Art, was also great he made sure we were all doing alright and having a great time! Extremely courteous and professional! Will definitely be coming back here again!", "Had the best bachelorette weekend at Sandbar! Jason Shotts and Arthur took care of my girls with a smile on their faces! Thanks for the hangover!! A must stop in Santa Barbara!!", "If there was a lower rating than one star I would give Sandbar it. My friends and I, a group of 20, went to Sandbar this past Saturday and had a terrible experience. As soon as we walked in a few of us sat down, and some went to the bar. The ones that sat at a table did not get served until about 10 minutes of waiting. As soon as our server came up she had one of our friends kicked out immediately with no explanation, and did not even ask any of us for drink orders. I went to the bar and the bartender was not friendly to me either, and multiple friends felt the same tension from the associates as well. Before we left a friend and I wanted to speak to the manager to let him know how we felt and how we were mistreated. The manager completely disregarded everything we said and did not apologize once. The bartender later apologized to me and my friends when we had left, which was a nice gesture and I appreciate it. But honestly I will never go back to Sandbar and give them my service.", "My first time at sandbar and my experience was awesome, we were greeted as soon as we walked in... Right after they sat us Chelsea took our order she was very prompt with our drinks and taking our order... Great hospitality from Chelsea. Food  recommendations were awesome. Great Ambiance. Defiantly coming back.", "Loved this place!  Service was super friendly (and good-looking) and the place itself was very cool. I liked the atmosphere and the food was delicious as well. I got the cilantro lime carne tacos and they were sooooo good. The tortillas were homemade and the salsa was yummy! My friend got a burrito, which was huge. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dinner out and some good Mexican food.", "Had an incredible time at this place, three nights in a row! Brandon, the bartender really took care of our bachelorette party! Drinks were delicious and kept us motivated all night! Thanks Brandon!", "Fantastic breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Best deal is breakfast. Sat and Sun 7.50 for brunch. 9-11am only", "I liked this place a lot last time we visited Santa Barbara. But this time I was told no entry because I wore a tank top. Hmmm... a beach town Mexican cantina and it's 80 degrees out. And a no-tank dress code. Sorry Sanbar. Uno star.", "A hip place to go when you visit Santa Barbara. After a great day at the beach it's time to party on State Street. A cool bar to hang out. Good music and even better scenery. Not too bad!", "Great place to kick back and have a meal with a beverage. Aw some atmosphere and wonderful staff.", "I'm from Carlsbad, CA and visit SB at least once a month. THIS IS MY GO TO PLACE!!! I mean what's not to like?? Atmosphere is so cool and chill. Then you have amazing drinks to choose from or ask JASON to whip up something special. The food is always consistent and delicious with large portions and low prices. Service is always great!!\nHuge S/O to the management for doing such a great job running the restaurant!!", "Went to Sandbar last night for a bachelorette party and had the best time! Arthur and the rest of the staff went above and beyond for us, giving us free champagne and a free \"special shot\" for the bride-to-be. The DJ was on point and seemed to be very good at feeling out the crowd and playing music to suit the audience. Great mix of new and old. Can't speak more highly about this place- go there!!!!", "As someone who travels for a living, I'm a huge fan of the outdoor atmosphere and the friendly staff. I also like that they support the local animal shelters with a drink special that gives proceeds to them!", "I can not ever go to State St. without hitting up Sandbar! Yesterday, we celebrated my cousin's 21st birthday. Despite roaming the streets of SB on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, we were seated right away, and had top of the line service. A few girl's ordered house margaritas and were very pleased. My choice of drink was a Bloody Mary, and it was delicious. Mr. Jason Shotts took care of us that afternoon, and we were so pleased with our appetizers, drinks and the ambiance of the place. We love Sandbar, and can not wait for Summer Fiesta's!", "Took forever to get a beer and when the server finally came to give it to us she slammed it on the table like she was pissed we were here", "THE SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLY HORRIBLE. The WORST I have ever experienced in my life.\n\nMy girlfriend and I wanted Mexican food today. We took the negative service reviews on Yelp with a grain of salt and gave Sandbar a chance...\nWhat a mistake.\n\nWe were there for brunch. Got sat immediately and salsa with chips (some odd chili salt on the chips) came quickly. The waiter asked for our drink order pretty fast.... We NEVER saw him again! 15-20minutes later we still had not received our drinks. (Water and beer take a long time I guess.... Scarce commodities!!!)\n\nI cannot comment on the food as I would have died of malnutrition waiting for food!\n\nThis place needs new management!!!!", "Went here for Cinco De Mayo with some friends. They had circulated a flyer advertising $5 drinks. In fine red print, however, it said \"until we are packed\". The clause was vague and the place was lit by red light bulbs which made the print nearly impossible to read. I asked the bartender and she said the price changed at 9pm, which the flyer didn't say. A friend ordered drinks after me for $5 a piece. For how much business this place does you think they would learn to be more consistent. Don't cheat your customers...", "I LOVED the Enchiladas de Mariscos! Best dish I've had at a Mexican restaurant, and can't wait to go again!\n\nLillian was our server, and she was attentive and helpful!!", "Just finished a day at the SB zoo and decided to get a bite with my family, I might add that it was Mother's Day! They only had a few low tables that would accommodate us, being that we needed a high chair. The hostess was awesome and sat us as soon as one was available! The wait staff was super friendly and great! Service was fast and the food was really good! Good margaritas too!!! I thought that they might treat us second rate being that we were a family and this place was happening, but was very pleasantly surprised by how awesome they were!", "You can tell by my other reviews I'm sort of the Mexican food freak who has to review everything. It's becoming my second job because I love TACOS. They are my favorite food followed by enchiladas. Anyway, we decided to hit up this place because it was across the street from where the concert was going to be (The Struts rock!). I love the atmosphere- it's like a Zanzibar Moroccan Mexican Indiana Jones meets a Kardashian who has a baby with Julio Iglesias. The chips were awesome, and that's the mark of a great Mexican place. Warm and salted just perfectly-- and amazing salsa. So, I order a combo plate and it was to die for. The shredded beef was like cooked by God himself. The enchilada and sauce was so savory. Even the rice and beans were delicious. I saw a few comments/reviews below mine regarding the service. I will admit the service was so-so. She took forever getting us stuff, forgot a drink or two, took 20 minutes to process the check out. But, I enjoyed the food so much I was a little less bothered by it-- and it was also super busy that night. I'm coming back up here soon and I'll hit it up again. What a nice oasis!", "Ok. Monday afternoon and we were cruising state street after a lovely weekend in Santa Barbara and found this place. \n\nIt was a great find for what it is. Actually it was better then what we expected it to be! Amazing fish, Pescado Del Dia, and ceviche - we even love the free chips and salsa. The chips were thin and warm and lightly seasoned. The salsa is homemade, which is not what we expected when we discovered it. The staff was good, sweet natured and friendly. \n\nSitting out doors on state street - this is an exemplary Santa Barbara cantina with great tequila and probably really hops on the weekend!!!!! \n\nGreat happy hour from 3-7 pm Sunday through Friday.", "I love Sandbar, it's the perfect place to just chill and hang out with your friends while enjoying a drink or a meal. \n\nEvery Sunday from 9am to 11am they have the special brunch deal where you get an alcoholic drink + brunch entree for only 7.50$! Best brunch in town! Must check it out!", "Some friends and I strolled in, just wandering around downtown. And we ended up spending the entire day here! The bartenders are AMAZING! Especially Amanda- wow!!! She was welcoming, and had wonderful drink suggestions. I would definitely suggest coming here and ask for Amanda!", "My sister and I drove to Santa Barbara a couple weeks ago, to meet some friends for a mini vacay. On the last night we walked over to Sandbar. We had actually met the guy that was hosting , earlier  that evening, while we were having a drink at another nearby bar. His name was Shotts (I'm pretty sure that's his real name ) we had THE BEST TIME!  The bar staff (Art,Brandon and Gini) were so FUN and so attentive! We loved them and they made us feel like good friends. Thanks for the invite Shotts! We will be back in a couple months. We didn't get to try the restraunt because we had dinner earlier, but next we will. Thanks for a great ending to a great vacation!", "A seriously amazing 5 star review. From the hostess to the bartender to the combo platter including tacos, and enchiladas, delicious! Amazing mojito and even more amazing chips!  5 stars, a must! Amanda was our bartender and she was amazing!!!", "Love this place! !! Food is great, drinks are better!   and the waiters/hostess are all really nice and helpful!", "Always friendly service and great drinks. Come with an appetite! Great food. Nachos, tacos, ceviche and quinoa salad were all delicious. Great food , reasonable prices and a fun open environment with pleasant people.", "Oh yeahhhhhh sandbar! This place is dope! It's named after some sort of geographical location but I wouldn't really know cuz I never paid attention in geography class, cuz you know that fly ass honey Jessica b. Sat in front of me and I was straight peepin on her every single class. They made all the tables into a maze which is a fun way to try and make it to the bar. They also got a bunch of shit on fire outside idk how this place isn't burnt to a crisp yet. But I'm no pyrotechnician, at least not yet, I have my aspirations ;) (wink). Got the tag team Brandon and Paolo behind the bar slangin dem drinks boii straight crushin it. I swear I come in for those two\nLovely faces alone. If only they would combine their beard and fro. They got dopppppeeeeeee enchiladas with mole blanco which is short for chocolate. That's right son, chocolate enchiladas, ya heard me! Don't forget they blend Mojitos their which is pretty much the most insane thing I ever heard of, go get some, bartenders love making Mojitos and they love blending stuff too. Perfect score of 5/7 would get lost in the table maze again!", "This place is a blast! Came to Santa Barbara for the first time for a bachelorette party and spent our whole time at Sandbar. The hospitality of the employees was unbelievable and the DJ was on point! Every single employee went out of their way to make us feel special and taken care of. Special shout out to Shotts and Brandon behind the bar for our drinks, Arthur for more drinks and great service, the DJ for letting me play and everyone for letting us close it down!", "Had the chicken enchilada suizas here today and they were great! Jordan, Jaime, and Jeremy were all very helpful with my decision and I felt very welcomed here. They were very informative as well and reminded me of the happy hour, which I didn't realize was going on so I got 2 beers for the price of one! Fun environment and people here at sandbar.", "I've been extremely disappointed with food and bars in California so far.  I came across Sandbar last night and I was beyond impressed.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly (and attractive) and they seemed to really care about making sure I was getting everything I needed.\n\nI ordered the ceviche and it was amazing.  Everything was super fresh and delicious.  I had \"The Perfect Margarita\" and it was damn near perfect.  Prices were fair too!  \n\nDefinitely worth checking out!!", "Becoming a usual date night for my husband and I. Great customer service, very friendly, get seated pretty quickly and amazing Tacos!!", "Love this place. Always smells like fajitas in there. I'd check out the half Asian bartender J Shots, he likes to give massages while you eat and not in an awkward way.. The little guy behind the bar named Richie was quite amenable to my guy and girlfriends!", "Waited more than half an hour to get a drink tonight. I saw someone complain for the same thing and get kicked out and figured I should just leave too before I got angry and complained about the same thing.", "Came here for lunch and wasn't impressed. The tap beers were flat and and warm and the service sucked. Food was ok but i wouldn't go back expecting a good time. Overall its a bunch of kids from Isla Visa running the place that don't know what their doing or care.", "Came to Sandbar for dinner and drinks. Ended up staying all night. Food was pretty good. The drinks is what kept me here. Bartender Brandon kept making try new drinks all night. They got better and better every time. It's worth a try if your looking for good food, great drinks and great service on State Street. I'll be back Sandbar!", "We try to get here whenever in Santa Barbara.  A \"perfect\" margarita (or 3!) and shrimp tacos and you'll be jonesing for it soon after.  Miranda the hostess could not be a better representative of Sandbar!", "Sandbar is not only a great restaurant but the atmosphere is so much fun, Loved the whole vibe of the place. Kudo's to Levi. He was so helpful and just such a hard worker with a great attitude :).. Thanks Levi for making our experience there even better than we had expected!", "A hip place to go when you visit Santa Barbara. After a great day at the beach it's time to party on State Street. A cool bar to hang out. Good music and even better scenery. Brandon, Chris, Jason, and Jeremy keep my beer glass full every time.\n\nDid I mention the scenery???", "Our Happy Hour experience at Sandbar was delightful.  It started with Lauren's warm welcome. Our server, Lillian, was attentive engaging and laughed at all our stupid jokes. Overall it was a great experience. Thank you to Lauren and Lillian!", "Amazing service, great food, ample seating, awesome bar, and a dance floor -- What more could you ask for? We were visiting from the bay and Shotts was more than helpful in recommending some sites to see and Chelsea was the sweetest waitress we had the entire trip. Thank you for showing us a fun time. Can't wait to come back!", "Lillian was great, she really know the menu and all her recommendations were great. Playa burrito was amazing! Lillian was very patient with our large party (12 ppl), even offered some watermelon cubes to pacify our 1 yr old little monster. Great experience, great food, and great venue!", "One star for rude management! His name was Aaron and definitely should not be managing! Confrontational should not be your first and last impression of a restaurant. That's all I have to say about that.", "Had brunch here this morning and you can't beat the price. The bartender Brandon was great! Super attentive and never let our glasses get empty. Will definitely be returning", "Went today with my family and we had Lilian. She was AMAZING!! Super attentive and provided great service. Drink and food was delicious and came out promptly. We don't live in Santa Barbara, but we come out every once in a while. We will DEFINITELY return!", "Great for brunch. Sat outside. Really friendly service. Food is good, but portions on the smaller side. The carnitas Benedict was amazing!", "This is not an establishment I would visit. My fiancee and I wanted to make reservations because we are getting married in Santa Barbara and wanted to celebrate our night with great music and food according to the reviews. The issue: we do not drink. Just because we are non drinkers does not mean that we are not allowed to enjoy and spend out money on food and non alcoholic drinks. When I said that we are non drinkers-the emails to make reservations ceased. So because we are not the kind to get wasted and would rather be sober to enjoy our wonderful time in a city we have never been too and will be celebrating a moment in our history, our money isn't good enough for this business. OK fine, thank you for letting me know what you think about customers and I will make sure to enjoy Santa Barbara without this business. We made our reservation elsewhere.\n\nSandbar, discriminate much??", "We were just in town for the weekend for Father's Day and we did some shopping on state street and decided to stop in for happy hour. The service was ok, server forgot to put in our order of chicken strips but other than that we loved it! The patio was amazing and the horchata Pina colada was so so so yummy!! We will be back!", "They had my original review deleted for reporting my experience of racism.\n\nLong story short, they would have gotten 5 stars, but the service changed when two black guys joined our table. The servers and bartenders, who were once nice and courteous, started ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. \n\nThe food was good but not worth the expense of my dignity and belief in equality.", "Casual atmosphere. Great salsa, chips were slightly undercooked giving them a chewy constancy. Not sure if this is standard or just the batch we got. The Carnitas Benedict has ruined me for all other Benedicts, so amazing! My husband ordered the Papas Rajas Hash, they were pretty delicious too.", "We came by for dinner and me and my best friend had a great time. The food tasted  fresh and amazing. Our server Katie was really sweet and on point. She was very busy but she stayed attentive and took care of us. The manager Art checked on us and made sure our drinks were filled. I highly recommend this place!", "The staff is extremely unprofessional. I understand it's a sports bar type restaurant so the overall vibe is going to be more \"relaxed\" but my experience was unbelievable. \n\nI went to their happy hour with a friend and noticed we weren't getting the best service, i.e. it took over 10 minutes for our server to greet our table. We looked around and realized why - one server to eight tables. Clearly poor management and not the server's fault. Seeing that my friend and I both work in restaurants and have dealt with similar situations, we disregarded the poor service and proceeded to enjoy our time. \n\nThen at one point our server came up to us, holding back tears, telling us someone else was taking over our table because another employee told her we commented on her terrible service (which we didn't, we commented on the restaurant's poor management). No doubt it was the hostess who had been giving us dirty looks throughout our time there. \n\nAbsolutely unprofessional! We couldn't stand being there for even another second so we left and ended up giving a generous (25%) tip to assure that server she wasn't so bad and honestly, to keep her from crying more.\n\nSolution?\n1) Hire better hostesses who, instead of listening to guests's conversations creating drama, actually do their jobs. There were always people waiting to be seated when the place had only 8/25 tables sat.\n2) Train servers to conduct themselves professionally. Servers shouldn't be so easily offended. I've had some people say very rude things to me and NEVER has it occurred to me to approach the table in tears telling them how \"hurt\" I was. That was absolutely absurd and I've steered clear of Sandbar since then.", "I love the sandbar. This is just a great place to hang out and do some people watching, eat an appetizer or a full meal or just sit and have a beer or a soda and relax while friends can come and go and visit you if your local. You can either sit inside at the bar for communal conversation or out on the patio for a little shaded privacy or if you're like me you sit out along the sidewalk to get a little sunshine and do some people watching. The servers are always friendly and cute and the Decore has consistently changed over the years and is extremely comfy. I still remember back in the day when this was calypsos. The sandbar has come along way and I love what they're doing with it always. This is one of my local go to's when I just want to chill with a couple friends and chat.", "This is definitely my favorite place in Santa Barbara!! The food and drinks were both amazing. Alma was my server. She was amazing, knew the menu and could recommend a drink based on what I usually liked. I started off with the perfect margarita and let me tell you it was perfect!! I also tried the ceviche omg! This tasted amazing and I loved that there was a lot of fish! For my main meal I did the pollo adobo tacos yummy! The atmosphere was great. Everyone was so nice and friendly. I couldn't of asked for a better more enjoyable place to go to. It will for sure be go to place!", "I've been coming here for years and up until today I've never experienced such bad service and horrible attitude from the servers. We were a group of 4, got seated, ordered 3 beers, and some guacamole to start, after experiencing such disgusting attitude, we quickly finished up our drinks and asked for the check. Used to love this place when visiting from L. A. but after this experience, NEVER stepping foot here again.", "Where to begin? Not only is the sandbar is a great spot to have some drinks and delicious food (try the ceviche), but the bartenders are the most friendly in town!  Request Jason S.--he is the absolute greatest--and knows how to have a great time. He makes this place worthwhile", "Manager has no concept of customer service. Disrespectful and rude. As a local I will never return or recommend. Dropped $400 and had chairs removed from group by the manager. Enjoy at ur own risk. Severely disappointed and highly recommend another place.", "The black dude at the bar in the back over charged me for my drinks. He pocketed it too because i checked the orders and my $26 of cash for 2 drinks wasnt on the bill.", "Can you start by saying that the entire staff at this locaton was racist and very unprofessional?  I had some family in town from Iran and wanted to show them Santa Barbara, we went to this location based on all the yelp reviews they had. It was early and the place was not busy but we liked the big patio and figured lets give it a shot.. We walk up to the hostess, and 1st thing right off the bat she askes to look into my bag? when I gave her a confused look she stated \"that in light of recent events they are checking peoples bags\" ( or better my bag becuase no one else got checked!) Mind you this is a 70lb little girl who would have been blown over if I sneezed to hard...but I figured why not, I got a backpack with towels in it... she took a quick glance with out even moving the towels around to see if there was anythingn else in there...but I guess thats what happens when you have your hostess playing security guard... . so any way we get seated and then ignored and after about 20 minutes, I literally had to waive down the waitress... like I was directing airport traffic.. our waitress finally comes and asks if we want drinks...we went ahead and ordered drinks... I was even thinking about ordering her one too,  cuz she was so dry and rude... and looked like she needed a shot to get her out of her slump...well another 20 minutes goes by and finally we get our drinks, which were the most watered down garbage drinks I have ever had in my life... at that point I had already decided that we are out of here... and never coming back!", "Great Food!  Great service!\nDUSTIN. Was Awesome\nAsk for him when you go\n\nHe is Cute too\n\nAddy Walker", "They have THE best chile rellenos EVER!!  Great service, the food came so! The chicken me is awesome, my husband raved about the braised beef!", "Good was fantastic. Chile relleno was the best I have ever had. Service from bartenders was better than most.", "Good Foo Great service  Enjoyed sitting on outside patio.  Relaxing. Completely contentedly eating", "Love this place. Nelson is the best bartender. Fajitas are on point. Nightlife is awesome. Check out reggae night on Wed", "I can't believe you call this a Mexican restaurant the service is poor the food does not have any spice or season you whatsoever. What are the restaurant do you go to work when the main entr\u00e9e comes before the appetizer. They really need to do the homework on the Mexican food and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's hungry or has a taste for Mexican really disappointed.", "This saddens me.. WAS my favorite place but after today ill never be back.. to start the host had no personality,  our server heather which we only saw one time.  our drink order took WAY to long, a michelada and a mimosa.. with no apology afterwards either.. we both ordered Carnitas Benedict our normal order the greens were warm.. the worst part was listening to the bartender talk to other people with an upset tone mind you its only 945 am... about how she does not receive tips and tired of being shafted we heard this across the patio are whole entire meal... in the Past  I have written amazing  reviews about this place today will be my last visit", "Came in for brunch this morning and had a great experience with heather as our server! Had such a great time that we moved to the bar and had a ton of fun with Roxie and Royce and ended up staying all day. Overall great experience and definitely recommend heading over for some food and drinks!", "I've come months ago when I was in town. Tonight the bar was pretty good. Tonight Jeremy was amazing and made the recommendation to mix the mango margarita with some jalape\u00f1o. Perfect for those that love to some heat. He had some good recommendations for those that prefer it mild as well.", "My favorite spot on state st! I've been here dozens of times and I am always satisfied. Their burritos are the best! They have so many options. I love the presentation of their food as well. Their guac is so fresh and creamy. Their drinks always hit the spot. The decor is perfect especially for Santa Barbara. I love sitting by the fire pit when is colder outside. A must try for sb.", "Honestly can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and remembered my servers name. I've only been to sandbar twice but had multiple staff members help me each time. Chelsea, Heather, Abby, and Roxy absolutely made my experience and I look forward to coming back soon and being waited on by your fabulous staff. All of the girls were very knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding area, constantly checked up on my table and were genuinely friendly people. Overall, great experience!", "Let me just say that I LOVED this place. As a visitor from LA, I'm used to lots of typical Mexican food restaurants. But I stopped by Santa Barbara on my way to the bay, and I couldn't have been happier. First off, what a great setup. It's open and lively which was a nice pick me up for my trip. Secondly, the service was AMAZING! Our first server Heather greeted us in a timely manner, gave us great margarita recommendations. That Perfect Margarita was truly perfect! I love tart drinks. She has good taste! Then my server let me know she was going home, and Brandon took over, and he was just as amazing! He recommended the crispy chile relleno and enchilada, and it was so satisfying. The chile was over this really savory citrus sauce and I was impressed. Brandon came by in such a timely fashion, checked up on us, cleaned up, and made sure we were having a great time. We left happy and ready for the trip north.", "It's one of the most amazing places I have ever been too! I wish it was place like this in la!! It's very cool and chill atmosphere stylish interior and amaaaazing food! I loved sangria more than margarita from happy hour menu!! Delicious! Also shrimp quesadilla is out of this world as well! Love love love want to come back as soon as I can", "CRAZY good value for money and CRAZY good service from Lillian at Sandbar. The food was delicious and generously portioned. Breakfast burrito & pancakes (what an awesome combo!) was enough for 2 people! Plus 2 large mimosas and a coffee (with unlimited chips & salsa) made for a decadent brunch. This place is worth getting up early for!", "Wow.  Incredibly impressed.  The food was amazing but the service was truly incredible.  We got their names so that we could publicly thank Heather, Arthur, Lauren, and Luke for their amazing service.  They treated us like friends and guests and we left feeling full and very happy.  Our group of 9 all really appreciate it, so thanks to all 3 of you.  Next time we come to Santa Barbara I guarantee we'll be back.", "Nicholas is the best bartender here. The blended Miami vice is amazingly refreshing! I wish they could clone him to work 7 days a week. The fajitas are on point as well! Check out reggae night on weds!", "Came here yesterday for lunch and can't wait to go back!  There aren't too many places you get it all...great atmosphere, great food, and great service!\nAtmosphere: most of the seating is outside in a patio that looks out to State Street and is so nice on a summer day, trees, cool candle holders and lights hanging from strings. Very cool setting.\nService: I wish I remembered his name but he was so attentive and friendly. We never had to look for him, he was on top of it (without being pushy)\nFood: Chips were fresh and very good (had seasoning salt which I liked), salsa was also really good.  I had the chicken sandwich and my mom had the braised beef sandwich....both were amazing! \nWish we were able to go back later last night because they had a live reggae band play. I will definitely be making a trip from L.A. to come back here!", "This is my first time using yelp, but I had such a great experience at Sandbar I just had to make an account and share. I came here over the past weekend with a friend. It was extremely busy but we managed to snag a couple seats at the smaller bar in the back. My friend got a watermelon margarita, which she loved, and I ordered an old fashion. The bartender asked me how I wanted it and I told him traditional. He made it perfectly, which honestly surprised me being that it's a Mexican restaurant.  The bartender (Chris) seemed super busy but was extremely nice and helpful. He answered all of our questions, let us know the happy hour specials and gave us a run down on the most popular items. We split the fajitas; they were decent but not great. Still giving Sandbar 5 stars though because of how friendly and accommodating our bartender was. Its rare to walk into a crowded bar and be treated and attended to so well. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely be coming back!!", "This place is AMAZING! Went for the first time tonight and loved it- awesome atmosphere, yummy food and amazing service! I would highly recommend it- our server Christina was fabulous and so kind and helpful, the whole waitstaff with nice and accommodating! Try this place! Can't wait to go back.", "I went here yesterday for lunch and absolutely loved the place! We sat on the patio, the service was quick, the staff was extremely friendly and the food was so good!! I ordered the chicken enchilada and chiles rellenos plate with a jalape\u00f1o/ cucumber margarita. So, so good!!", "First experience was great. Second experience not so great. We came On Sunday, the day before Labor Day. They had happy hour menus out. We asked our server if we could wait till 3 to place happy hour and she replied \"we do not have happy hour because it's a holiday weekend.\" We called over the manger for clarification.. She rudely pulled out the menu and pointed to small print on the very  bottom of the menu (that you couldn't even see when the menu was in the holder) where it stated \" prices subject to change during holiday and special events.\"  She said they are \"corporate rules\" that no happy hour options occur on the the holiday weekend. Well the holiday didn't start until tomorrow. We aren't cheap. We will pay full price but think their menus should reflect their restaurant rules. Manger apologized and bought our table a round of drinks. (This didn't make up for her unprofessional behavior) Shortly after the DJ came up behind us and screamed \" you guys got a problem. It's memorial, I mean Labor Day weekend.\"  Inappropriate behavior coming from 30 year + man. He obviously had too much to drink during his shift... After he confronted us rudely he went to the bar and sipped his alcoholic beverage. Disappointment for sure considering this place is one of our favorite places in SB that we visit frequently. In summary, our server Chelsea was great.  \nSide note: as we were leaving the manger Katie pointed at a sign that stated \" because of the holiday weekend we will not be offering happy hour\" and then said \"just saying.\"  (Weird that the sign just appeared) certainly the sign was not present initially as patrons were entering.", "It was Santa Barbara Pride weekend and we needed last minute dinner reservations for 7 guests!  My friend Troy was able to reserve a table at Sandbar.  Great location right on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara.\n\nWe arrived to find the host and hostess asking some drunken customers to leave the restaurant!  I was really impressed with how they handled the situation and were able to be friendly while deescalating things.\n\nAfter they were out of the way... we checked in and inquired about a table on the front patio.  The staff quickly cleared the table and got us seated!  \n\nAll throughout dinner, not only the server, but the manager also continued to check on us.  Such friendly staff... even wished us a happy Pride weekend!  Food and drinks arrived promptly.  Everything was delicious.  Splitting the bill 7 ways?  No problem for them!\n\nThanks for an amazing dinner handsome Arthur, hottie Luke, and adorable Heather!", "The experience was great.  We only came in to get an ice tea and sat at the bar.   Jeremy who was serving at the bar was fantastic.   He asked us how we were, where we we from etc.   He was great.   Even offered us a coupon to come back for brunch, but said to us have a great stay if we don't come back.  Thanks for a great experience.", "Service is excellent had Heather as a waitress twice very efficient friendly and fun loving \n\nYou can tell that the manager on duty Art keeps his staff having fun and taking good care of the staff\n\nFood was very good had the enchilada and chile relleno with the queso fundido skillet appetizer \n\nMargaritas are also excellent", "We had a slight incident with the host but it was quickly resolved when the manager Art went above and beyond his duties to accommodate us. The food was delicious and our waitress Jenny was great!! We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends & we plan on returning soon!!! Thank you Sandbar and Art!!!! It truly was a pleasure!! #weekendsbirthday #crutch", "Sand bar is very popular bar in SB.  if you like a manageable crowed of people type of place this is great. \n\namazing margaritas and the food is also good. This place is best for the vibe fun and atmosphere. It's a very happening bar. \n\nOutside has a fire place which is fun to sit around and mingle with others. The tables outside also have heaters. \n\nIf your visiting and like to drink definitely go here.", "This is an awesome spot in SB!\n\nWe just loved the ambiance and decor of this really cool spot. Great for food, drinks or just to people watch. \n\nWe sat in the patio and enjoyed our afternoon having chips & salsa, drinks and a really big lunch. I ordered the chicken burrito combo that came with two sauces, rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious right down to the last bite!\n\nThe servers were amazing. They took care of our group without a single problem. I recommend making reservations because it is a popular place and you don't wanna miss out.", "Richie is the best bartender ever. And he is not too bad to look at. Just don't have him open an olive jar. Best time ever", "Best chili rellenos ever!. Crispy fried. Not baked and Soggy. Food was very good and authentic . Margaritas were just average. Kind of expensive for drinks. Awesome atmosphere inside and outside seating.", "Came here on a Sunday night for a friends wedding after party and had a BLAST. The music here is pretty on point as they play tons of hip hop throwbacks and pop hits. We got extra service because of our wedding situation including nachos and champagne. Super glad that we ended up at this spot because it was a perfect way to end the weekend :)", "This place is getting 5 stars from me not only because everything we order was excellent, but because of the excellent service we received! It started from the second we walked up. The host, and I wish I had the guys name, but he was working around 5pm this past Thursday night, was so sweet and kind and patient with my husband and I and our 2 babies!! Yeah, 2! It's rough going out to grab an adult dinner with a 3 year old and a 1 year old but the staff here made us feel welcome, like we weren't bothering anyone and find everything to accommodate our family. Our waitress, Heather was just as sweet and attentive. Thank you to everyone working here for being kind and patient with us and our little family and for some Excellent Mexican food!! Ps- we are from San Diego so I do feel like we've been exposed to delicious Mexican food and are qualified to categorize this place as such! lol", "Went there last weekend and had a great time! The food was great, and loved the chips and salsa! Very friendly staff and great seating. Will return in the future!", "Very bad service. Half of the tables were free but the hosts said there is 15 min wait time and when we seated at the bar to wait she said it's busy and we better leave phone number and she will give us a call when they have tables...", "Great food and atmosphere, turn into a night club at night. Love the patio seating with the beautiful laterns and fire pits. Had a great time and might be a stop for us the next time in Santa Barbara.", "We had a vary large group and this was a perfect place for unwinding.  Great appetizers, drinks, and we really enjoyed the music.  This is a very fun atmosphere! Can't wait to go back!", "What a joke. Went there with a group of five at 2 in the afternoon. Even tho there was a big open table out front we couldn't have it because we were only ordering drinks. Several tables open!  Then when the hostess said we could not bring our bottles of water with us?  Are you kidding me?  Buh-bye", "If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I've never been to a restaurant that I had to send back the water!!!\nI don't know how toilet water taste but, I'm assuming it tasted what I received last night! \nAlso, the margaritas were watered down! The only thing decent was the chips and salsa.", "My girlfriend and I drove to Santa Barbara for a concert this week and has the pleasure of eating dinner here before the show. It was recommended by our hotel concierge and SandBar did not disappoint! Our server Dustin did an exceptional job explaining the menu and even making recommendations. We will definitely be back and make recommendations to friends and family! Cheers.", "Great service, great value at breakfast, great outdoor seating, tasty!  Macadamia nut pancakes amazing! Salsa is killer! Loved it!", "Great place... good vibe... BUT - horrible service and weak drinks. Our server was a blonde bimbo who acted like she was doing us a favor,  and tried to ignore us. When I told her that the drinks were weak, she wanted $7 for an extra well shot... what a rip off!!  I don't know what the management is thinking, but good drinks and good service without the crappy attitude are PARAMOUNT!!! They will be receiving a call from us.", "We were here this past week as part of a road trip and boy did it deliver. Best guac I've had hands down (don't tell my girlfriend who makes a pretty mean one).  The enchiladas were also incredible.  The place has a really cool ambiance with string lights and heat lamps and bartenders are super friendly. Ours was named Mike, who was extremely engaging and was doing an excellent job taking care of customers on a pretty busy night. We stayed for about 4 hours and I would do it all over again!", "Door man was a bag of tools. Wouldn't accept my wife's Washington state ID or her military ID. Didn't ask for date of birth. We moved from washington to California. Whoever hired that moron should be fired.", "Sandbar is the best!! Run by Art who is the BOMB!! You would be hard-pressed to find a place more fun. Good and strong drinks. Great food. And the prices are fair. The atmosphere is always festive and fun. It is absolutely an industry favorite. And it's always a party at the sandbar!", "Tried to grab a drink and a bite to eat on NYE at 8 o'clock and they tried to charge $20 just to get in the door. There were a ton of open tables. If you're going to offer a full menu, don't expect to be able to charge a cover charge because it's a holiday! 4 parties including myself walked next door where they were happy to get our business.", "Came here for the weekend.......literally was here Friday Saturday and Sunday. We made friends with Art and he was so cool. We had a group of 18 and had so much fun. We hung out with a little person named Paul who we met on new years and my friend mal hooked up with this Arab guy she met. my friend zack ordered the carne asadadoo with the Reano and he said it was really good. The patron wasn't bad either. My friend Sam liked all the music the DJ played and my friend mar hooked up with the DJs girlfriend by the bar. At the end of the day it was great. Art was amazing and I would recommend the breakfast baritto.", "I go here quite a bit with friends when we have time.\n\nThe chicken tacos are amazing here. I love the mixed drinks as well. \n\nDenisse is such a charming host, but I barely ever see her! I need more Denisse in my life! :(", "Arthur Basehart is an amazing professional bartender that needs to be recognized for the work ethics and great example for his fellow associates.", "It's a joke. My husband and I came in on a Tuesday night... there's no one here and it's been at least 20 minutes if not more and we still wait for some knows of service. Don't waste your time!!!", "Food was delicious, drinks were strong and the atmosphere was fun! Made a reservation on open table and had no problem getting a table for our large group!!", "Enjoyed good Mexican food, friendly wait staff, and cozy, street-side seating between two heaters. The enchiladas mariscos pair nicely with Modelo Negro on tap. My wife had the pollo adobo tacos. Also delicious. We'll be back.", "Came here after a work meeting on a Monday evening.. Couldn't have been more of an excellent experience. Friendly hostess, fantastic bartender (thanks, Shotty!), delectable steak tacos,  and of course, a few nice drinks.\n\nThe drink a coworker and I shared was the Blackout Beach; nice way to kick off our happy hour. Everything was decently priced as well. Will be back in the future when in the area.", "My friend and I came for margaritas and appetizers, and were more than pleased with our decision. We ordered the fresh fruit muddled margaritas (strawberry), and they were delicious! They were recommended by the bartender, and did not disappoint. The chips and salsa were good--the chips had some seasoning on them to make them extra tasty. We ordered a chicken quesadilla as an app, and it was insanely good. We kept commenting that the chicken was probably the best quality that we'd had in a really long time. Definitely surprised us for a bar!\n\nWe sat at the actual bar inside, and the service was exceptional. It was a Saturday night on State Street, but the bartenders took everything in stride. They remembered orders, were super polite, and one bartender was even keeping an eye on people sitting at the tables. He would get on a Walkie talkie to let the servers know if it looked like they needed something. I'd definitely recommend this spot!", "I've been wanting to come here for the longest and I'm really happy I finally had a chance to experience this place! From the cool decor to the delicious chips and salsa, I was impressed from the start. I was with 2 of my co workers and they both ordered appetizers which were delicious as well and our drinks were all on happy hour prices (which made me extra happy). The bartender Jason, who goes by \"Shotts\", was so friendly and fun! Can't wait to be back in Santa Barbara so we can stop by this place again", "If you are looking for a happening restaurant with great food and an enthusiastic\nenergetic atmosphere, then The Sandbar is the place to go. Though I only came for food, as most restaurants close early in Santa Barbara, I was astounded by everything. Service was a bit slow, but the food was worth it. Be aware that it is not a cheap place to eat and drink. I recommend all to stop on by and give this place a try.", "Got here for a late dinner with my girlfriend, and the crowd was out of control. The bouncer was very rude to my girlfriend, and she even complained about him whispering something inappropriate in her ear. Yikes! Then little to our surprise we found a hair in our gauc. Overall my experience here was horrible to say the least. I will not be returning here, and hope the wall is built a bit North of this place.", "Really enjoyed the whole experience!\n\nOur server, Ali, went above-and-beyond, and definitely coming back!\n\nThe blended Mango Margarita was smooth yet strong, and their standard Margarita was just right, perfection; the food was amazing...\n\nHad the shredded beef Taco, chicken Machaca Enchilada Y Relleno . . . not heavily salted, loved the enormous amounts of cheese, and couldn't finish it all through one sitting, but had to take the rest home... Great for munchies later, as that totally happened!\n\nBoyfriend enjoyed his braised beef Enchilada too, he was jealous of my plate.\n\nThanks again, and looking forward to coming back!!!", "Always a great experience coming to Sandbar! \nThe service is impeccable, The food is spectacular :) Art the bar manager is the man! Always making sure my crew doesn't go thirsty!\nAaron the boss was able to handle a late request of 35 people! Even though they were packed when we got there; thus, they handled it to perfection!\nThis is why I always come back!\n\nThank you Aron and crew!", "Love this bar! Such a good happy hour and yummy food. Kory is the best bartender, he makes delicious drinks and is easy on the eyes too. You have to try his mojito, perfection.", "Loved this place so much! The bartender Mike was so helpful, just wish his beard was cleaned up a little bit.", "Ben and Mike made our experience so fun! The two of them are like a dynamic duo. We stopped in on a whim to have a margarita when we noticed the great atmosphere. We were greeted so warmly by these two guys, so we ended up staying for dinner. The drinks were great, and the food really hit the spot. An authentic California experience that was simple unforgettable. (mike or Ben: if you read this I left my # on the receipt )", "Awesome place !! Visiting Santa Barbara and happened to walk in. Only came for drinks and an appetizer. However we sure wish we had time to eat dinner! \n\nDrinks were great and our braised beef nachos were amazing!! Probably\nBest nachos I've ever had. And that's saying a lot.", "The Sandbar is outstanding! Wonderful restaurant and bar. Great entertainment. We were on a sales retreat and we took 20 of our peers to the bar and I left my credit card. I did not realize I had left it till I got home 100 miles away. I called the restaurant and the Mananger mailed it back to me the same day. I can not give this place and it's staff enough accolades. Thank you so much.", "This establishment has extremely BAD service.  This is my daughters birthday and they couldn't accomadate our table wishes.  I would understand if they were busy but it was  2;30 in the afternoon and the place was mostly empty.  WE DID NOT EAT THETE", "People here were awesome great food great environment great drinks coffee and a glass head on the the best.. would definitely come back with my wife and I..", "Fajitas and burritos were fantastic. Our waiter was in training so I understand that our drinks were late, but still very good service. Good outside seating with a fire built into the table.", "Every time I've walked by, I've always felt \"Tourist trap, don't do it\" - Not sure why today was different. I mean Mexican food in SB is a dime a dozen and more often than not - the really \"trendy\" places are a raging disappointment.\n\nThe hostess mentioned that if we were cold to let her know and they'd be happy to turn the heaters on (it's in the 70's today but the section we were in was kinda drafty) and she even offered to hold our stroller for us.\n\nAliex is literally hands down one of the top 5 best servers I've had in SB. He was super attentive, great energy and kind. You can tell that he's passionate about what he does and truly enjoys it. He should give server training to literally every establishment in SB. The food could have been garbage and I'd still be stoked to have been there.\n\nThe food is NOT garbage btw - it was surprisingly different and tasty. I'm pretty confident that the steak for their nachos is braised in unicorn magic. It was unbelievably tender and flavorful and NOT salty (something hard to come by in SB).The burritos are incredibly large - I mean - enough to feed 2-3 people probably. He was also really nice about our odd food requests (usually servers get super annoyed - but it's hard to get kids to try something new).\n\nThe bussers were friendly - attentive and sincere. This was absolutely not the norm for SB. So glad we stopped in. Can't wait to go back again.", "This particular incident happened multiple weeks ago, but it's been weighing on my mind ever since. Two guys I met earlier in the night, who were both very respectful and genuine people, were not allowed in the bar. This was because the manager, a shorter gentleman with zero hair and a bad attitude, wouldn't allow them into the establishment. They were not drunk or acting in a disorderly manner at all and were very cordial. I can't stand when our vets get treated with disrespect and I hope this will be remedied in the future!!", "Great place to have drinks, food and watch sports. Outdoor seating next to fire pits to stay warm. Atmosphere is great and the waiter, servers and bartenders were very friendly. Highly recommend this place if you want to relax and have a couple drinks or food.", "About a  5-6 weeks ago I was driving up the coast from San Diego and made a pit stop at beautiful Santa Barbara. Walking up State Street I found this great looking restaurant to stop by for a margarita while I do some business work on my laptop. It was very early on a Thursday right after they opened so there was almost nobody there, which made the wifi work great.\n\nI had a cute little spot where I could people watch outside while enjoying my margarita, and because it wasn't busy I was able to chat with the host, Chris. I work in the pharmaceutical business in San Diego and didn't expect to talk with a restaurant host about cutting edge research done at the nearby university, I almost wanted to offer him a job on the spot for when he graduates! After enjoying the house margarita (which Chris said they make the mix in house), I wanted something a little more spicy and he recommended the diablo margarita with roasted jalapenos, and it may have been the best margarita I have ever had. I also tried the steak tacos, which may have no been the most authentic Mexican food, was still A+ food.\n\nI'll make sure to be back whenever I make this road trip again, unfortunately I couldn't make it on my way down.", "I booked a bachelorette party there for 10 on a Friday night.  I think something didn't get transcribed by the event coordinator since we arrived there and we weren't in the books, but I had a message from the event coordinator with the correct party details.  Initially, that a bump in the road, but they made up for it.  Got a seated right away, free drinks, boas, balloons, decorations, etc.  Jason was super accommodating and hooked it up.  He was our favorite person by the end of the night.  Their DJ was really good too.  Food was decent.  We would've gone back again on Saturday if we could.", "Kory was my bartender last and that guy was the best sooo helpful ! Made sure I had a great time and was always on top of grabbing drinks very little wait time. Highly recommend going to sandbar ask for kory !!", "Kory is amazing. Best Moscow mule I've ever had! Such great service. I will be coming back and recommending this place to my friends.", "My favorite place at Santa Barbara! The food is amazing and the Mango margarita is a must!!! Love coming here such a great vibe", "Best restaurant in Santa Barbara hands down....amazing mixed drinks....strawberry margarita and Bloody Mary's are the best....for brunch the Carnitas Benedict Croquette are the best for Sunday brunch....for lunch and dinner i always get the taco & Chile Relleno", "Both nights I was in Santa Barbara I found myself returning to the Sandbar. They had really delightful drinks, wonderful service, and a very cozy atmosphere. This was a great place for late night eats and drinks as well as an intimate setting for a dinner for two!", "Best restaurant and bar on State Street.  Excellent service, thank you Lillian, food, and ambiance.  First time visited for dinner.  The new remodel makes for a cozier and warmer feeling.  \nOur server was absolutely the best.  Lillian knew the menu backwards and forwards, was extremely attentive, and we loved the entire experience!!\n\nDefinitely will recommend to friends and family, and come back soon myself!!!\n\nWow, visited again on May 12, 2017 and once again this great place impressed all of our foursome.   We came in from a long and exhausting cycling trip.  Food, service, and value all spot on!!! Dustdin, was the key to making this an unforgettable visit.\n\nProbably visiting in the near future!!!\n\nThank you Dustdin!!!", "The best thing about this place is the comfy couches. Lazy service, even though it was so slow. Chicken was dry, drinks were sub par. Go to the funk zone instead.", "Wouldn't let our party of 4 in because my friend had baggy jeans.  Totally rediculous.  We were dressed nice and would have spent money.  Lame.", "My bachelorette party was amazing thanks to Sandbar and more specifically Jason Shotts ! The DJ was great playing a variety that had us dancing the whole night. Jason was such a gem hosting us 9 ladies that we returned Saturday night too (next night) and canceled our bottle service and reserved table at EoS to be at Sandbar. We'll be back to see you Jason ! Thanks", "I have never written a review on Yelp before but Jason Shotts at Sandbar has given us such IMPECCABLE service and attention for my girlfriend's bachelorette weekend that I can't help but write one. He was SO sweet, such a gentleman and took care of us for two nights!!! We definitely came back the second night after he was so nice to us. He even went out of his way to hold our coats for us in the back while we were dancing and gave us all water bottles at the end of the night and made sure we were all okay. The second night he reserved us a nice table around the fire pit and continued to be incredibly professional, polite and gave us superior service!! Will definitely come back again with more friends next time I'm in Santa Barbara! Thank You Jason!!!! You made my friend's bachelorette weekend and our night :)))))))))", "Sandbar was everything we could have asked for during our bachelorette fiesta! Jason really made sure we felt safe and secure but also showed us a great time!! The experience was so fantastic, both of our going-out nights were spent at Sandbar! Thanks to Jason and the Sandbar team for helping out our bride squad!!!", "Love this place!!! I was celebrating with a large group of girls over Memorial Day weekend. We checked out many other places along State Street and the Funk Zone, and this was the only venue that we returned to for a second time during the entire weekend. The music, vibe, and crowd was SO much better here than other places we were at (ex. Indocine and Tonic). \n\nHave to give a big shout out to Jason Shotts - he was a gentleman, and treated us so well!! He made sure we had a great time and were taken care of, and overall is really funny and friendly! Also he did things that were next-level, like making sure our belongings were safe and giving us plenty of water between our rounds of drinks. Plus, he makes a mean margarita. Highly recommend!", "Horrible experience.  The wrong food was brought to my table twice. We ordered guacamole and it was brought to our table twice.  We were brought the bill right after and told we were not being served because one of us was too drunk?  None of us were drunk. I will never come back to this establishment!", "They have a great happy hour from 3-7 Sunday-Friday. Buy one drink and get another for a quarter. (Wells, Calls, All Mexican Draft Beers, Domestic Drafts, and House Wines) $6.50 skinny margaritas and house margaritas!", "Disclaimer: This review is solely based on our attempt to get a table here & being turned away because we had a stroller.\n\nWent around 7:30pm on Saturday night, it was my husband & I & our 1 yr old in a stroller. We went up to the hostess & asked if they could accommodate a stroller, that we were willing to wait. She stuttered a bit & then said sorry we don't have a table right now. Never looked around & never asked any of the waiters. Unfortunately, it was quite clear that there were at least 4 open tables behind her, there was no wait & we were only being dismissed because she didn't want to deal with our stroller. \nDefinitely wouldn't recommend going here if you are looking to be treated respectfully.", "Terrible service. I had a reservation for my 21st birthday, and the waitress completely ignored my group for the night. She only came to our table to take our order and deliver the food. Never asked if we wanted more drinks or needed anything else. We gave them my birthday cake to light the candles; there were only 2 candles, a 2 and a 1. The waitress came out with only one candle lit and said she couldn't light the second one. My friend had to stop her, fixed the candle for her, and light it herself. Then when the check came, it was $400+, and the waitress didn't even give us the option to at least split it into 2, so one person had to front the huge bill. Highly disappointed, especially since it was my 21st birthday.", "Best strawberry mojito in Santa Barbara. Jeremy the bartender is great!! Food is good as well! Stop on you won't be disappointed!!", "Such friendly staff!! Tarra made us feel super at home and Roxie at the bar always has the best suggestions!! Good chips and guac, great vibes, and solid food. Def come", "Sandbar is the place to be. Tarra and Roxy are the sweetest and definitely made our night. Great vibes all around", "Tarrah is the sweetest! She took care of us and our graduate! If you guys come here, ask for her, you won't regret it!", "This place never disappoints. Try to snag a sidewalk table to watch the parade of locals, students, tourists and kooks walk by. Inside is also very fun and lively with a Cabo-like Fiesta feel. Staff is super friendly and helpful from the hostess at the front to all of the waitstaff and bar folk throughout. \n\nYour basket of chips arrives and there is no way to resist them. Light, crunchy and addicting. Almost anything on the menu is good and the portions are plentiful, big enough for sharing. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. Our only gripe is that the margaritas were light on the alcohol so maybe order a shot on the side to ensure their potency.", "I went here with a few friends on a Friday night and we didn't wait very long to get a table. The serving staff was delightful and quick to help us. I ordered a happy hour drink and a perfect margarita. Both met my expectation and were delicious. In addition, I ordered the fish tacos and they were gone before I knew it! The ambiance is terrific, especially the open windows connecting the inside dining room to the patio. I would definitely go there again, and probably will in the future.", "Always one of the stops i have to make while in Santa Barbara. Great drinks and a totally fun atmosphere. Today the bartender Chris was awesome. Totally helped with plans for the rest of the day, made great drinks, and had great conversation. The fresh fruit margaritas were amazing as well as the jalape\u00f1o margs. Will def be back before I leave town", "Excellent service. Great food. This is a family tradition every time we come out to Santa Barbara. Grateful for this spot and for Ben with his excellent customer service. Made the whole family feel comfortable.", "we tried to enter the restaurant at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night which was half empty and one of us had a USA basketball t-shirt on and they refused us entry cuz we were wearing a team shirt. Never heard anything so dumb as we are proud of the USA and we were ready to spend a bunch of money on drinjs and dinner. We will never go back.", "This is the first place I ate at in Santa Barbara and I keep coming back every time. It has an awesome atmosphere and a patio with a great view of State St. The host Celeste welcomed us in and managed to get us in right away even though it was a busy Saturday night. Great service and great food. Definitely recommend!!", "This is probably one the best place in Santa Barbara to hangout. I went there with friends and we sat outside to enjoy the atmosphere which is awesome, the food is delicious and margaritas are the best. The service is terrific and the staff is friendly and efficient, the first impression that we got was cheerful and pleasant: Willow, the host made us feel very welcomed and Ben, our server, was very friendly and attentive. I totally recommend this place!!", "Honestly, my boyfriend and I came here because it was happy hour which is buy and drink and get another for a quarter. \n\nI ordered a strawberry margarita and he got a double jack and coke. To be honest with you the strawberry margarita was disgusting!\n\nThey made me a house margarita with 6 mashed strawberries in the drink! Who or how does a bartender NOT know how to make a strawberry margarita?! How can one mess that up?! \n\nThe food was ehhh! It was not out of this world! \n\nI ordered enchiladas suizas with grilled corn and to say the least it was kinda bad! The corn was \"grilled\" not sure how many hours ago or days because it had a funny taste (just saying) but when I got mine it was cold! Like if they got it from the refrigerator and just slapped it on my plate! Nasty!\n\nThis place is what it is 3 stars! I never checked YELP before coming here! Wish I did and could've spent my money elsewhere like at EL TORITO! Lol \n\nThe food and drinks were as bad as their service and 3 star ratings combined!", "The fajitas was quite delicious!!!!  I enjoyed the strawberry margaritas!!  I definitely recommend.", "The waiters and service here is the absolute WORST you can imagine. We came in here to celebrate my wife's birthday and had a utterly\nDisappointing experience.\nThe waiter was rude and completely bored. Since we were a party of 14 I guess they knew we had to pay a 18% gratuity.. but they didn't put an ounce of effort to earn in. At one point the manager yelled at my friend for absolutely minuscule issue which was too much for us and we ended up leaving. \n\nI hate this restaurant because they lack basic civility.\nI would give them a zero rating for hospitality.. freaking idiots!", "Horrendous experience.\nCame to this place to celebrate a friends birthday and left very disappointed with the overall experience and hospitality. Some of us had stepped out for a minute and were returning back when one of the manager yelled at us for stepping back in from a different entrance. Complete lack of sense and no respect for the customer.\nDon't go here. There are better places :)", "Very rude and possibly racist management. Ignored us and shouted at us when a few of the trip decided to leave but come come back. The manager (short shaved head guy) does not have basic communication skills neither can he run a restaurant. We had a reservation for 12 and had 2 extra people join us. We were refused 2 chairs citing a fire hazard. Later, the same spot was filled with people after they converted it to a dance floor. After paying $500 + for dinner, we expected better service.", "Mexican food is my favorite and this was the best by far.. The environment was fun good delicious and great drinks... Can't wait to come back again.. Everything we ordered was wondeful", "My absolute favorite place to eat at in Santa Barbara! The food is delicious, they give you a great amount of food, the atmosphere is super fun, and the service is ALWAYS excellent. :)", "We come to SB twice per year and we visit The Sandbar at least twice each stay. We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The servers are friendly, the drinks are amazing, the appetizers are awesome and the food is fantastic!\n\nImagine our heartbreak when we arrived and found it temporarily closed.... AAAAGH! PLEASE open again soon Sandbar. We already miss you.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe Sandbar is open again and just as fantastic as before!  Keep up the fantastic work, Sandbar!", "Does anyone know why they're closed (temporarily) ?  Was on my way there this evening. Great place !!", "this place was horrible, we were served on chipped plates, really & the tacos were stone cold, we will never go back", "Great foods and drinks. Also super fast service, everything is brought to you within 15 minutes at most. \nFun weekend place", "Passed by on Friday evening and they said it was re-opening nite so we had to visit. Tasty burrito and chile relleno, good salsa and an energetic environment...what's not to like. Very reasonable prices leaves enough cash to buy more drinks...", "Husband and I shared the supreme burrito, it was delicious and filling. We sat at the bar and enjoyed just hanging out. We had beers, I also a had a raspberry mojito and my husband had a Cadillac margarita they both were great. We love this place when we visit Santa Barbara.", "Horrible host called \"tailor\" was a bad person, she didn't dress appropriate, is rude and uneducated.She asked me how many in my party then I said 4, at the moment I was with my 5 year old and myself, then she said when the other people come then I will give you a table and I said I came all the way from Granada Hills, she said so?..., and I said I'm tired and hungry can I sit down she said no!! Then I said ok give me a table for 2, then she said if I give you a table you cannot move to another table if the other people come, honestly I wanted to leave but I said I will eat and leave quick but no, they took forever and the seats were dirty,the ceviche had no flavor and no  lemon (the lemon tasted rotten and/or tasted like the lemon from the bottle) I asked the nice waitress for lemon and she took forever, (15 minutes) to bring them, then they were old and they tasted horrible, the ceviche was a small portion for $16 !!!! The guacamole was unseasoned. The lettuce in the Caesar salad was bitter and the entire salad had no taste. At the end of our experience there, I asked for napkins and the same girl tailor said \"we don't have napkins\" and I was confused as to why a restaurant does not carry napkins. She was very rude to me so I told the closest waiter what had happened. He gave me napkins and told me that he will notify the manager. It was extremely expensive and the service was horrible. I do not recommend this \"restaurant\" to anyone at all. I hope they fire that tailor", "When it comes to an overall great dining experience, Sandbar stands above the rest. \n\nLet's start with the drinks. They've got a large tequila section, but their margarita's homemade sweet/sour is what steals the show. They've got cocktails for every type of drinker, a nice selection of drafts (including local breweries), and some nice wines as well!\n\nThe food is awesome and full of flavor. The chips and salsa is addicting, so make sure you save room for dinner! My favorite menu item has to be the Enchilada Suizas. Enchiladas are my jam! If you're looking to share, get the fajitas. They're huge and coming out piping hot.\n\nThe service was friendly, fun, and great at what they do. Everyone seems like they are there to help. The bartender, Megan, was very attentive. She even helped me pick what to eat when I couldn't decide...there's so many options! \n\nIf you're looking for a place to party, Sandbar has an awesome night life. They seem to have a dj or live music every night!\n\nThey even have the placed decked out for the holidays! I love the giant Santa out front. This place has a lot of character!", "Food was awesome had the beef taco, cheese enchiladas and chilli Reno. Service was on point as well", "Two words: Unlimited chips.\n\nIn more words, this place is a happening and tasty joint. We went on Christmas Day and were greeted with the smell of margaritas and the comfort of lounge chairs, heaters, and traditional Mexican decor. The service was exceptional, the ambiance was fun, and the food was damn good (holy-guacamole-kind-of-good).", "Mariay represents the entire experience of family-fun- festivity!! Our niece turned 21 and Mariay created celebration for us!! We lost our home in the Thomas Fire - and Mariay created comfort for us - \nSandbar is a good place to come for relaxation and rebuilding the soul!!!", "Brought my parents there for a quick dinner. Food tastes good and service is great (given it was right before new year and they were so busy)! Our waiter (I didn't get his name, my bad) was patient and hustling. Good vibe, too!", "We came here today on New Years Day. Everything started off great. Food was great and our first round of Margaritas was wonderful. It was 3:05 pm and we went to order a happy hour drink (Happy hour every Sunday-Friday 3-7 pm) and we were told they weren't running happy hour today. They had the Happy hour menus on the table... advertising the deals and we were denied...so we left.  I would rather go pay full price for a drink somewhere else... it's the principle.", "I went to Sandbar with my Industry boys for the first time and Tarrah helped us out with our drinks. She was so friendly, and helpful and made the experience worth being there. We've been to a lot of bars in SB, and this is hands down one of the best experiences we've had. 5 our of 5 would recommend. We'll be back.", "The food was fantastic, I recommend the tacos for sure. Also the staff is amazing, Austin one of the host was so nice and helpful when my family wanted to move seats. Also if you happen to go ask for Dustin! Amazing waiter, can't wait to visit again!", "I love going to sandbar. The vibe is relaxed and and everyone that works there is really nice. Gini is the best!!! Always great service. Happy hour has good deals and the chips and salsa are the best.", "Every time I come to Santa Barbara, I'm always excited to come to Sandbar! The service is great, Tarrah is always super friendly with everyone! The drinks are great, the food is delicious and they always have fun parties and events! Definitely a must when you're in SB!!", "Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat, drink and hang out! Food is great and so is the happy hour! Friendly staff. Gini, one of my favorite bartenders always makes sure my friends and I have a great time when we go in!", "Good vibes and great customer service! Our server Dustin catered to our 18 person party like it was a daily routine. Never saw a water glass empty at any point! This place has good food and great service, will definitely be putting this on my list of top restaurants in Santa Barbara! Thank you sandbar for the wonderful experience for my family and friends.", "Great Happy Hour Sun-Fri! Buy a beer get one for 25 cents! Half off appetizers! Their regular menu is great as well. The combos on the back of the menu are huge and of quality ingredients!", "Was looking for a place to eat while visiting Santa Barbara with my boyfriend. Came across this place and I must say it was great. Aesthetically wise, it's appealing. Many chances for great photos and he way it's set up has a really cool vibe to it. Waitresses are nice. Were attentive and the food itself was delicious. I got the chicken machaca crispy taco and the cheese enchilada combo and I truly enjoyed it. My boyfriend got the grilled asada burrito and it was huge. He usually eats a lot but he got super full on just the burrito. We didn't get any alcoholic beverages but looking around me , many of their margaritas looked to die for. Would come again 10/10", "Great place to eat, drink and dance. I love the way they got their fire place set up.", "Justin returned our lost phone. Thank you so much!!! Maya is a great waitress. The staff accommodated my entire family quickly (party of 12 and a baby). Service was fantastic. Great place to eat on State St. We will definitely come back many times more.", "Great crowd. Awesome service, and delicious food. Cool artwork and loved the big TV screens.", "Went here with my family to have lunch.  Service was fast and friendly.  Went to use the restroom before we ate.  After about 15 minutes realized I didn't have my phone with me.  Went back to the restroom to see if it was where I had left it, and it was gone.  Asked Justin if they had found one and they promptly returned my phone.  Service was great, food was great and thanks to the staff and Justin for returning my phone.  Nice to see a restaurant that has great food, drinks and a staff with integrity. Will be come back again.", "We had a great experience at Sandbar. It was a perfect spot for a bite and cocktail on happy hour. Ryan was really helpful and patient with us. We had a very large group and he continued to check on us to make sure everything was to our liking and we didn't need anything else. Happy Hour for drinks was an excellent deal- one drink normal, one for a quarter. And a whole list of food options for half price! Definitely a spot to stop in when you're here(:", "Honestly, I don't usually come here because it's too busy, but industry night and happy hour is fire. Tarrah is so nice and really made the night.", "I've came here for over 5 years and within the last year coming here I've had a server by the name of Alex which has been the most attentive server I've ever had since I've been here.. I never post reviews at all, but when things need to be brought up from someone above and beyond doing their job, I will definitely go out of my way to make sure it's noticed and needed to be seen. Congrats Sandbar for hiring awesome servers.", "Went to the sandbar last night and had the most amazing time! The margaritas were delicious and the service was exceptional. Austin was so friendly and accommodating. Thanks to the great service my friends and I had a wonderful experience. We will be coming back!", "Love this place!! Good friendly service, good ambiance always a good time!!\n\nThis is always my go to place in santa Barbara.", "Stumbled upon this cool place while walking around and exploring the town. Immediately drawn in by the view of people having a good time. The food was delicious and the staff was attentive, but I like the overall decor and feel of the place. Didn't have any drinks, because had a long drive back to SF, but will certainly sample some tequila at my next visit!", "Came in on Saturday day with my family for some afternoon Mexican food. Ordered some burritos, tacos, and drinks. The sangria was delicious! Also want to shout out Alex and Katie! They provided us excellent service and made it a memorable experience for us! They accommodated our party of six without hesitation. Thank you sandbar!! P.S. the shrimp tacos are amazing :)", "Had a great dinner with excellent service!  Ryan was an excellent waiter and the food was delicious!", "Ryan was an awesome server, Sandbar had great food, excellent drinks, and a very fun happy hour!!", "Had a quick dinner at Sandbar before heading to the downtown farmer's market. The achiote chicken quesadilla was sooo good! The tortilla was crispy, and inside are delicious melty cheese and chicken... Mmmm! Also, the meal was very filling for me (took some left over home) despite that the price was surprisingly cheap (about $7). A very enjoyable experience here.", "This was a spur of the moment decision to go here after a run we finished in SB. It was a Saturday around 11am. It wasn't too crowded, the food was DELICIOUS, and service was great. The drinks were buy one get one for a quarter. The mango mimosa was really yummy and the mahi tacos were even yummier. Highly recommended!", "This hit the spot after a 3 hour drive coming into town from LA area. Staff is friendly and courtious. Happy hour was great. Get the vodka lemonade and the watermelon vodka, refreshing and it it tge spot. Outside is great to people watch.", "This place was nice until we got kicked out for no reason ? We were obviously 21 but the people next to us were barely 20 soooo maybe you guys should not kick out the ones older than 21 because we are legally there compared to the other guests there. Never coming back after we spent lots of money. Bye thanks for nothing !", "Great little place to eat! Love the vibe, had great/friendly service. The fish tacos were delicious! I also had a jalape\u00f1o margarita - they get high marks all around!", "While traveling in CA, and after a 7 mile hike on Channel Island, we had dinner here. Fun outdoor atmosphere with heaters for a chilly but beautiful Sat evening. Delicious seasoned chips with salsa brought almost immediately to our booth. Burritos and shrimp quesadillas were some of the best we've ever enjoyed.", "Super slow service. 20 minutes for an iced tea and a well drink. 1:40pm on a weekday.\nFood was subpar. Had the shrimp quesadilla. Shrimp had a weird, spongy texture like it wasn't cooked. \n Service speed was horrendous. This place is all hype, don't waste your time or money here.", "Loooove their chips and salsa, they have huge water and soda cups, amazing virgin frozen margaritas, and the best Chile rellenos and hard tacos.", "Came in for some lunch and the place was busy. Found a seat at the bar and ordered some food. Didn't take long for the food to come out, and it was really good.  Only thing better was the service, even while being busy Gini took great care of me.  I left satisfied and slightly buzzed. Good times", "I am relatively new to Santa Barbara and haven't been to many restaurants. A friend of mine came into town and we decided to have dinner out. Well, I'm so sad for my first experience taking her out we ended up at this place. We arrived and the hostess didn't acknowledge one of them asked \"how many?\" And then walked away. We were sat and were given chips and salsa and about 15 minutes later (after asking two other people for assistance) finally received service with the server never apologizing for not receiving service and stated \"they never told me you were my table\". His response was pitiful. I will never return to this establishment again. Horrible service and not worth it.", "This place is amazing! I had there tacos and they were absolutely delicious.  Great service, friendly staff and great environment. I highly recommend.  I live in LA and stop by to deliver a car for a client and had the best experience! Thank you Josh", "My friend Robin and party of four were not let in because one person had baggy jeans. Not the way to run a business let alone a club type of business. You won't be seeing any of my groups going there ever again.", "Came here with 5 other people, were seated immediately for dinner... which was the only positive point of the experience. Service took entirely too long - example: we hit the bottom of our chip bowl before we even received our waters. Drinks took almost 45 minutes to reach the table. Would have ordered more food / drinks, but we didn't want to wait another hour for service.\n\nHowever - the kicker was the end of the evening. My friend who paid the bill accidentally left her card in the check presenter. When she called to make sure it was there, it took 45 minutes to even get someone to pick up the phone. When they finally did, the gentleman on the phone said \"you know what, it's really busy and loud over here, you'll just have to come in tomorrow to see if it's here\".\n\nWish I could give zero stars for customer service. Try elsewhere.", "I usually go for the happy hour once or twice a week. All the bartenders are fantastic, but today Ginny (despite being a Georgia Dawgs fan) went above and beyond. She was training the new bartender and was being attentive to everyone's needs. Definitely going to be coming back.", "Came here on a Saturday night because we were starving and couldn't figure out what else to eat that wasn't about to close or didn't have a super long wait time.\n\nWhen I get carded I sometimes say, \"Oh! I'm glad you asked because I'm older than I look!\"\n\nSo when this kid carded me he looked at me all bug eyed and said, \"You are definitely older than you look!\" And then he said the same thing to my fiance!! LOL all I could do was laugh!\n\nFood: We were seated right away and given menus. I ordered the Soft Taco Asado ($15.49) which came with two soft tacos filled with cilantro marinated skirt steak, beans and rice. My fiance got the Chile Relleno and Taco ($12.25), which came with chicken machaca, beans, rice, of course the relleno, and pico de gallo. I also got the Strawberry Tropical Daiquiri ($10.75) with their \"superior rum\". \n\nIn simple terms the food and drink were forgettable. I didn't even bother taking pictures of it. The asada didn't seem like it had much of the cilantro and lime flavor it's named after. The Relleno was just alright, not the best. And the rice and beans are rice and beans!\n\nService: While I was waiting for our food, I was looking around at other tables that had chips and salsa. I asked another waiter if they were complimentary and he said they were and said he would get some. I never saw him again. Once our waiter walked by I asked him for some. He came back with some and then came back to bring us our food, then to drop off and pick up our check. But other than that I felt he was more interested in talking to the other servers and those ordering shots.\n\nAmbiance: It's pretty loud in this restaurant, so this isn't a good idea for a date night. Maybe just to have a drink and then go eat somewhere else. There's also some homeless guys who were yelling at everyone (we were seated outside).\n\nParking: Parking was found about a block away in a lot that was about $1.50 for two hours (super reasonable). \n\nThis place is definitely not for kids or any type of family and I won't be coming back if I'm in the area again.", "I have always had a good time at Sandbar! The food and drinks are delicious! Taco Tuesday for tacos and margaritas is always a great choice! The staff and service is great. Tarrah goes above an beyond - she is always so friendly and makes sure each guest has a great experience and feels taken care of. I love staying after dinner for a little dancing on the dance floor as well! Great ambiance!", "Sandbar is so lit, Tarrah is so much fun and so helpful she really adds to to the experience", "My favorite place with the best margaritas! Love Tarrah, super sweet! I recommend ordering the strawberry margarita and a tequila shot!", "Great food, excellent service, Tarrah is your go to if you want to have a super fun experience at sandbar!", "Tarrah is the best!!! Yummy drinks and sick dog videos. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you", "Amazing service from Tarrah and a great tequila sunrise! Will be coming back. Definitely join the birthday club- really great deals", "Used to love coming here because the music wasn't as shitty as everywhere else (I.e sharkeez, o'malley's) but it's literally shit music now. Wish they would stick to beats that non-white people would enjoy... aka not Jason derulo and Katy perry. \nTried to ask DJ nicely to change and now no one is dancing.... take a hint and read your audience", "Back at Sandbar Santa Barbara!  Came up a couple weeks ago for a wedding, had fun on State Street. Settled at Sandbar for dinner. Great staff people, manager brought over a heat lamp for us, which was great!  Stayed longer cause we were so comfortable. Good food, nice people, service great!  So, we are back for some great drinks and atmosphere. Yum!  Two five stars for each time we come!  We are hooked! My post is for Saturday night, just flipped out for some reason?", "The nachos here are the best I've ever had. During happy hour they are only 5 bucks. What makes them delicious is the seasoning they add to the chips. Also the pork carnitas tacos are sooooo good! Really recommend, the tortillas are so soft.", "Yuck!  Everything was terrible - the guacamole, the drinks, the entrees.  The service fast (get 'em and get 'em out) but that worked for us as we were anxious to leave after such a bad meal.", "Ryan was the most attentive waiter I have ever met. He was fun, knew the best insider menu and made our every dream come true. If you come, find Ryan. He'll literally light your fire, fill your glass and if you're nice, the salsa will flow", "This is one of my favorite places in town! Tarrah is amazing and always hooks it up! Best music and vibes!", "I am celebrating my 21st birthday and I was willing to pay $3 to just use the bathroom and they refused me. Don't come here, they are rude and disrespectful", "I brought my cousin here for her 21st birthday and we waited in line. My friend gave the worker at the line a compliment and he told her our group was no longer welcome. He was by far one of the rudest person I have ever met. If you want to have a good time, DO NOT COME HERE.", "Came here for the first time this week. Our server Lucia was very nice and helped us pick out the perfect entrees. Service was very quick and food was very good but bring your appetite! Burritos are huge!", "Tarrah is incredible. Friendly and welcomes everyone. I come to sandbar for her. She has awesome promotion for parties, easy to contact, and has great customer service. She makes Sandbar great! Thanks Tarrah!", "Sandbar has become our destination of choice for lunch when my group of friends visit Santa Barbara for our annual train ride.  I've enjoyed the shrimp tacos-TASTY! and the bean and cheese tostadas- very tasty and the corn tortillas are the best!  Now for the cocktails:  GET THE MANGO MARGARITA!!  It resembled a 7-11 Slurpee but for adults only.   I've been back twice since our May trip.", "Terrible experience. Clueless teenagers at the hostess stand told us to seat ourselves. We sat and asked several employees for drinks before we were so annoyed we left. Waste of time. Snarky teenagers at the hostess stand recommend sharkeez! Great recommendation, quick and great drinks ! !", "Rude teenagers working at the hostess stand.  We sat and waited and couldn't get service and left.  They seemed to think it was funny at the hostess stand and recommended we go across the street to Sharkeez.", "Great crowds, nice people. Delicious strawberry margaritas and flan.  Our new way of enjoying life is to start with dessert and a drink. The food is always great!  Salsa and chips to start out sets our mood!  But the flan, yum!", "Service not very attentive. Lucia did not know menu. Ordered a fajita salad and she brought me a salad of oily onions and bell peppers. She said did not come with chicken. When looked at menu it said explicitly that salad included chicken. Asked her to go ask manGe and credit. She did not come back for 10 minutes and when finally asked her she said the menu was wrong. Would never have ordered a vegetarian salad for 13.75. I would not recommend this place for the service and Lucia was horrible waitress!!!\nWould not recommend this place!", "The bar is nice, if casual and college-y. We came in for the relaxed vibes, stayed because of Jeremy. He's a gem of a bartender - didn't know him prior to wandering in, but had an extra two drinks because of his recommendations and friendly demeanor.", "We enjoyed the Classic Bloody Mary and Horchata Pina Colada. The Pork Carnitas tacos were pretty good. They were surprisingly not dry and tough, which I have encountered frequently at eateries. I will order them again. There are a lot of seating options, which is great if you want to sit away from the loud music to chat, or hang out inside near the bar speakers. Our Server Lucia was helpful and took the time to point out some menu items my wife and I can try the next time we patron the Sandbar. \n\nThe five stars are for the service(thanks Lucia), food, and atmosphere in the category of a bar&food kind of place. It is not fine dining, but it is not a dive bar either.", "Had a great late lunch on their wonderful patio.  Chile Relleno was very good.  Margarita was delicious.   Great ambience.  Service was great.  Will come back again for dinner and music.", "Came in for a bachelor party on a Wednesday July 11th and it was a blast awesome staff especially Jenny that was there to help me set up everything and give us great service as well as the others staff bartenders where awesome good at pouring drinks and super friendly. The band was awesome great music. The groom was very impressed and had a fantastic bachelor party there was his words and so did all of the other grooms men. Thank you Jenny and the sandbar staff for being a part of our week adventure here in California (from Az) it was a great!!!", "Where do I begin!! Greater \"Keanu\" was so awesome. First time in Santa Barbara and we spotted this funky cool looking bar! We were tired and thirsty, He seated us and was very informative about the menu and drinks! He made our stay feel welcome. Our Server Aliex he was so sweet very patient with my aunt because she cannot make up her mind what type of drinks. Overall great experience food is great but the employees are better take care of them!", "The food here was great and my friends enjoyed their drinks..when they came 20 minutes after ordering them! We made a reservation for 11 people on a Tuesday evening, so we thought we might be given good service for reserving a nice spot in the back a month in advance. The service we got at this restaurant was awful which sucks because the food was amazing. Our servers name was Casey, and she didn't smile a single time while serving us. As a party of 11, she hardly came around to check in on us to see if we needed anything. When it came time for the bill she wouldn't split it up for us and then disappeared for another 20 minutes for us to figure out who pays what. Eventually we got up and tracked her down to made her take down all of our orders a second time so she could make up each of our bill. We were sick of only seeing her every half hour and we were ready to leave! It almost ruined the night but once we got out we went to some better bars! Please improve the customer service because the food is delicious.", "I highly recommend this place to eat Mexican food and drink wine. The service is fantastic!", "Apparently I forgot to hit \"Post Review\" on above yelp. \n\nReturned last week and had so much fun dancing!  Dinner was great my strawberry daiquiris delicious. Always nice people, they hustle to help you. We had a new gal, very sweet AND she got all of our orders right!! Two of us are finicky orders, she handled it perfectly!  Great music, fun crowd Lora of smiles and fun!!  Thanks again!!!", "We had a great lunch here . Nachos with braised beef were yummy. My watermelon Fresca margarita was perfect. The service team of Maray and Brian was quick, accommodating and courteous . Definitely will be back.", "I wish I could give this bar 0 stars. The moment I walked in I noticed the dress code for the bar: no gold chains, no baggy pants, no jerseys, no do rags, no beanies, etc. immediately I noticed how racist this dress code was. I spoke with a male promoter who, ironically enough, was wearing a gold chain and baggy jeans, but I presume was allowed into the bar because he was white. \n\nThe fact that we are still prohibiting entry for people in DO RAGS, and other OVERTLY racist items of clothing is so disgusting and needs to be addressed immediately. \n\nWill not be supporting this bar until they remove their racist business practices.", "The food was amazing!! I got the rolled taquitos and my mom got the steak tacos. Everything was perfect and the location is unbeatable :)", "Great food! Casey took great care of our party of 5 with aplomb!!!! Will be back!!!\nVirgin blended margarita was perfect for our daughter!\nMuddled margarita was great!", "Love this spot. Energetic crowd, great music and attentive bartender. Matt took awesome care of us and was quick to refill the drinks when we got low. Didn't try the food, but everyone said I should so will next time for sure!", "Fantastic deals.   Love the happy hour: buy one get one for a quarter.\n\nEmployees all worked together to make us feel welcome, even with a party of 12 and our complicated orders. \n\nJosh benson was very very understanding when a few things didn't come out on our picky orders.  \n\nI completely recommend this place", "The service and the food was exceptional! Our waiter Ryan was over the top attentive and helpful.  He kept coming back to see if we needed anything. We were here on a \nSunday and they had a fabulous happy hour.  I had the best skinny margarita I've ever had for only $6.75 plus a buck because they added fresh strawberries.  My boyfriend ordered a Pacifico and got a second one for a quarter! The guac was delicious and the quesadilla was filled with fresh and wonderful chicken breast.  We were way too full for the soft tacos that we also ordered. Can't wait to come back to Santa Barbara, Sandbar, and Ryan!", "Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. We've been to Sandbar many times before and everything was great from food to service. Today we went again with the family and place was awful. They put so much tables ( which was shaky and my husband asked for a coaster to put under a leg) around that there is no space to walk. Table was dirty and we asked 3 times to wipe it. Our waitress was a sleepy girl whom we asked 5 times for a napkins and never got ones , salsa and chips took her forever to bring( finally other waitress brought it). Drinks was brought up 30 min later with 10 min gap in between. Finally we \"caught\" our waitress to order the food which arrived on our table 1 hr 40 min later separately from each other. We complained to a manager. I don't think we will ever come back. For this restaurant is quantity over quality. Not the same one anymore", "I cannot believe just how disappointed and dissatisfying I was with this experience. I spent $30.40 + a $5 tip HH margarita was IMPOSSIBLE to drink bc of the stupid fruit. The enchiladas have absolutely NO sauce on them. Beans look disgusting the rice was cold and old. The taco has more lettuce & cheese than it does beef. And the fact that I asked for chips and salsa with extra salsa and she tells me it comes with it; dude seriously this small little cup with 2 meals in it and you give a small cup?!? WITH an oversized side of chips?!?! I loved this place when I last went. I raved about it. Nope- not happy now!\nWere going home tomorrow. Tonight we go to to bed hangry and really disappointed. Not cool!", "Poor service. Bartender had an attitude and didn't bother to serve us until we asked him a few times. No food menu was offered until asked and nobody bothered to ask if we wanted to order anything from the menu.\n\nNot worth a trip.", "Lunch stop on the way up the coast! Dog friendly patio which is a must and great choices in seating! Quest fundido on par! Chips and salsa ok.", "Good food, good drinks, cool atmosphere. The drinks aren't very strong and the food definitely isn't authentic, but it's still delicious. It's. Great outdoor dining experience", "Been here multiple times, all not the best experience. after I leave I always tell myself I am never going to go back but I always do. After this time I will not be returning. I was eating my taquitos and all of a sudden I feel something in my mouth.. and I pull out a BLACK HAIR (my hair is blonde). I get accidents happen and they brought me new taquitos but they did not comp anything for me, still had to pay for the taquitos.. very disappointed in this restaurant, will not be returning even when I am super drunk in need of a tequila shot..", "been here multiple times, all not the best experience. after I leave I always tell myself I am never going to go back but I always do.

Great service and great recommendations about the menu. She was ontop of everything from refilling drinks to refilling our salsas", "Came back to the yelp page to upgrade my previous review for Sandbar restaurant. I want to thank general manager, site manager, waiter and all staff who took care of our family today and treat us with a great attentive service and delicious food. Thank you for considering my review from previous visit and raising restaurant service to the next level. For sure will be back again and will recommend the place.", "Last  month me and my family visited this restorant  and we got upset . We had very bad experience with one of ur waiter ( very unfriendly lady), food came late, service was not good at all. I do not think so, that we want to pay money again for this horrible costomer service", "I would like to specially thank Kimi for providing my friends and I an ultimate experience this past thursday at Sandbar! Our experience at Sandbar was exceptional thanks to Kimi's excellent accommodation! She was very kind and helpful throughout the night and made this night our best downtown experience yet! I can't wait till I come back to Sandbar, and I highly recommend asking for Kimi if you are looking to reserve tables and for events! \n\nThank you again Kimi for the amazing experience at Sandbar!", "I went to sandbar to wait for a friend and ended up spending a few very enjoyable hours with Matt. He was attentive and helpful and a good conversationalist. He was willing to put up with my friend and I being loud and excited about an upcoming trip. Great service and excellent fun!!!!!", "Best Mexican food EVER!\nWe drove all the way from Palmdale Ca.\nAlex is the best waiter I've. Thanks Guys", "First time here and it was such a great experience!! Our server Aliex made our visit worth every penny !! He was super helpful and had such a great vibe. Highly recommend this place if you're ever in the area!!!", "Come for the happy hour!\nThis place was pretty busy on a Wednesday- and they have live music which was really fun.\nThe food was good, and the skinny margarita was delish. Plus- four girls getting apps and drinks during happy hour was only about $80!", "I always comeback to eat at the restaurant cause of the ambiance and the food tastes great! I recommend this place and it's kid friendly! You can't go wrong with that.", "Came in here for happy hour with my mom. Alex was a great server. The drink/food prices were unbeatable for the portion size during happy hour. Loved the vibe of the bar so much we went back the next day. Would definitely recommend. Alex (along with the other staff members) were polite and engaging.", "Great service, awesome \"perfect margarita\", killer shredded beef nachos and fun place to meet up with old friends and new.", "Understaffed. Make sure you have nothing to do if you're going to eat here because it will take forever. The waitress Valerie was a complete b'tch. She thought she was pretty hot stuff too, newsflash, you suck. If I was you I'd go to Rubio's instead.", "I've been to this place multiple times and have only had bad experiences. Now I'm done. I've been here for dinner and have been disappointed with the mediocre \"Mexican\" food and horrible service. I decided to give it a shot on a Thursday (college night) and took their bus (yes i paid $10 to them) Downtown only to find out I would be denied entry (with my valid California ID) because the signature on my ID wasn't raised enough (sounds like a DMV issue). The best part of all is that they let my friend who's a girl in with an expired New York ID (ha aren't they supposed to be more suspicious of out of state ID's?) To top things off every girl that I was with was let in and I was denied entry by the male bouncer and general manager at the entrance. The establishment treats their employees and guests horribly. What a joke. Wish I could give 0 stars...just walk a little further to Casa Blanca.", "I walked by on a Monday afternoon much to my surprise to see a packed patio. Sat at a fun high top all by lonesome for some good people watching. I watched the manager defuse a vocal old man \"who hated the mild salsa cause it was too hot and tell a young European girl she would get a ticket for smoking\". Yes santa Barbara is a smoke free zone, but they can't do anything about assholes. The manager kindly handled a volatile situation. The service was great. Greeted with a smile and two servers and manager, I promptly ordered a sandbar margarita which they deserved to drink too, maybe more than me. I told the manager the salsa was great, but it was definitely not hot.  I was then served a smoky hotter version, the diablo, which was tasty and should  be served regularly. I ordered the carne asada Chile relleno and it was cooked to perfection. I'd come back tomorrow if I could.", "NEVER go here. Unsympathetic staff, horrible management, just overall awful. Was trying to celebrate a friend's birthday and they ejected me for superficial reasons. Thought because I was trying to spit out their horribly mixed drinks that I was too fucked up for this place. Note that I am reviewing this place as I am \"too fucked up.\" Am I too fucked up? I don't think so. Fuck this place.", "Terrible, just plain terrible. My friends and I went to have some fun and unfortunately had an awful experience. Their alcohol was so disgusting that my friend could not swallow it so she spat it out. A worker thought she was trying to throw up, which she wasn't, and kicked us out. Did not listen to any explanations we had and just kicked us out over an assumption. How is that a way to run a business? We paid for nasty alcohol that we couldn't even swallow and got kicked out over it? If they'd at least had better customer service to combat their terrible alcohol, it would have made sense but how do you expect to stay in business when you treat your customers like trash. There are way better places in downtown Santa Barbara, I wouldn't even come back if they begged me.", "We have been coming here to watch our football games since the start of the season and have had a pretty good experience.  However, Taylor has been the best wait staff we have had by far!  Always checking up on us during the game making sure we had everything we needed, even offering recommendations.  Really had a good experience and looking forward to seeing Taylor sometime again!", "Justin made our dining experience awesome! Great service, atmosphere and cocktails. Yummy Pasilla Chili Rellenos, and fajitas, which did not include Carnitas. Not a problem, they were happy to make it for him, and the meal was amazing! Great HH bonus too! We'll be back soon!", "Just leaving Sandbar and can't express enough how great of a waiter Justin was. He was kind and attentive and provided great service. So much so, that I was compelled to write a 5 star review for him right away! Thank you, Justin, for making our time here a great experience and we will definitely be back!", "Great food! The service was FAB!\n  BUT THE FOOD!!  AWESOME-SAUCE!!\nGreat mexican food. And the salsa was great, but the chips, even better!!", "Worst place because of the management. The guy with tattoos named josh offered me and my friends bottle service for $40, so I gave him my debit card and he charged me $450. Make sure to look at your receipt when you order anything. Josh is a fraud and makes this place really bad", "This place is ridiculous. My girlfriend and I were in there on Saturday, ordered drinks, had lunch and left. Sunday, we return for breakfast, give the waitress our ID's to order drinks and she says she needs to put them under the blacklight (I have never been told this, but we said ok). They stay back there for 10 minutes and they come back to tell us they think my girlfriend's ID is fake. It is one of the new ID's and was issued by the DMV. He then says \"they are specially trained for this\" and I laughed in his face because obviously he has no clue what a real ID is. This is all ironic to me because they are notorious for getting in trouble for underage drinking. Hope this wasn't an issue because my girlfriend and I were holding hands and they wanted us out. We then went to Lama Dog where they took our ID's with no problem and said they had no clue what was wrong with the people at Sandbar. Regardless, do not go there if you want to be treated with respect! They don't know what respect is! I will NEVER come back.", "This place is an absolute horrible bar. I went years ago and the food was good for a bar watching  football on Sunday . Well I went tonight not only was the service the worst I've seen in years. 3 shots of tequila came out to $58 not including tip wow it took 15 min of standing at the bar with no acknowledgement. The bar was not even close to full. There's no excuse for service this bad. 4 bartenders maybe 20 patrons. I worked at a bar for 6 years. Literally the worst service I've ever seen. They need to clean up shop at this place ASAP. The owners must not be aware of what's going on here. Beware of this place. I'm never going back. And will tell everyone I know not to go. Truly upset about tonight.", "We stopped here for a late lunch expecting to just get something small to tide us over until dinner while exploring the area. We both ordered tostadas - he got chicken, I got beef - and we were blown away. The portions were very large and the food was so tasty. We ended up skipping dinner entirely as we were full and satisfied from this meal. Also, the price was super reasonable. I've never had a tostadas with such a great tasting salad component incorporated. I'm so sad that the Sandbar is in Santa Barbara and I am not! If we are ever back in Santa Barbara, we will definitely eat at the Sandbar again.", "Love the fire pit  and the service our server was Mariay she was amazing. We made sand bar apart of our post wedding crawl.  It was our wedding night and we got the most amazing service. Thanks for contributing to it. The margaritas are good just stick to fresh lime juice and agave...skinny anything else is going to taste like house mix sweet and sour.", "Wow what can I say.. This place is excellent. Not only did my food exceed my expectations but my server Brian was phenomenal. He described the menu in great depth and recommended the chicken sandwich. Very satisfied and will be coming back to see Brain.", "Great food!! Great pricing! Then at night it shifts into nightclub atmosphere. Brandon was super helpful in locating my credit card when I had lost it. He was prob also very patient with us knowing how are group gets. Place is tight", "Went on 12/13/18 with a group of friends and ordered \"the nachos\". Once we got the nachos mid way through we found about 3 pieces of paper which looked like straw covers. Manager has no empathy to this situation. Absolutely unnecessary and disgusting. How does the paper from the straws get into our food? I will most likely never go back to this restaurant and highly don't recommend.", "This is a really cool place. Santa Barbara has a bunch of nice places to eat and I can definitely recommend that this place is one of them. Our server was super cool, very easy to talk to and took care of everything we ordered. It also was pretty chill so our food came by pretty quick.", "Hands down the best steak fajitas this native Angelena has ever had. Fun vibe, cozy, and delicious salsa. Would love to come back for happy hour next time I'm in Santa Barbara!", "Happy hour menu and prices are great!  Service is awesome.  Allows small dogs.  Food portions are pretty big.  Left stuffed and happy.", "We went to this restaurant on Christmas day , almost every where was closed . We had just few options for the lunch , we got our table in 10 minutes.  service was really good and fast."]}}; }
